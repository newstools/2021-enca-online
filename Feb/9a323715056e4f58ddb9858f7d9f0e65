AFP/Franck Fife PARIS - The Six Nations match between France and Scotland in Paris has been postponed due to the numerous coronavirus cases in the home squad, tournament organisers announced on Thursday. In a statement, organisers said that a new date for the fixture, which was due to take place at the Stade de France on Sunday, would be announced "in due course". On Wednesday, the game had been given the all-clear to go ahead despite France's positive COVID-19 tests, but a 16th case was announced on Thursday and the entire team was put into isolation.
