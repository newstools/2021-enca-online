Daniil Medvedev is into his first Australian Open semi-final. AFP/William West MELBOURNE - A badly cramping Daniil Medvedev won a brutal all-Russian clash against Andrey Rublev to move into his first Australian Open semi-final, warning he was playing at "an amazing level". The fourth seed had more firepower than his younger, eighth-seeded rival in scorching conditions on Rod Laver Arena, grinding him down 7-5, 6-3, 6-2 to extend his win-streak to 19 matches. His reward is a last-four clash with either 20-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal or fifth-seeded Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas. "I would say the three last points when I was getting ready for the serve I could not really move my left leg," he said, with both players cramping in the "super-tough" conditions. "But I've known him a long time and I know how to neutralise his big shots. That's definitely one of the best matches I've played lately, not even just here but last year," Medvedev added. Medvedev is now riding a 19-match run dating back to November, taking in titles at the Paris 1000, the ATP Finals in London and the ATP Cup with Russia in the lead-up to the opening Grand Slam of the year. He is into his first semi at Melbourne Park as he continues to knock on the door of Grand Slam success, having reached the 2019 US Open final and the last four in New York in 2020. "Andrey I think at this moment is on fire, starting last year, so he was definitely for me one of the favourites to go far in this tournament," Medvedev said. "To win this match in three sets, especially how physical it was, I mean, it was an amazing level from me, and I'm really happy about it."
