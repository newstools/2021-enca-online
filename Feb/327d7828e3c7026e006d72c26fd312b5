The load-shedding is a result of network constraints on the Eskom network. READ:Â Eskom to implement stage 2 load-shedding City Power has apologised for the inconvenience caused to its customers. It says it is forced to implement load-shedding as and when Eskom experiences network challenges. Eskom says rolling blackouts are exacerbated by the forced shutdown of five generation units at the Medupi power station. The heavy rains in Lephalale have prevented the power utility from getting coal into the unit. Eskom implemented load-shedding from midday Friday, continuing until 11pm on Sunday. #JoburgUpdates #MediaRelease #Loadshedding
