Van Niekerk will be leaving behind his longtime training base in Bloemfontein. The 400m World record holder is reportedly set to undergo the tutelage of top US coach, Lance Brauman. He will train with the likes of 200m world champion Noal Lyles. The 28-year-old won Olympic gold in Rio 2016 with a world record of 43.03 seconds, a record he will be looking to surpass in Tokyo later this year.
