Daniel Cardoso of Kaizer Chiefs challenged by Thatayaone Ditlhokwe of Supersport United during the DStv Premiership 2020/21 match between Kaizer Chiefs and Supersport United at the FNB Stadium, Johannesburg on the 20 February 2021 JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs' frustrating season continued yet again, albeit this time they had to settle for a 1-1 draw rather than lose maximum points.
Amakhosi who were coming from another damaging defeat at the hands of AmaZulu got the headstart against SuperSport United. Reeve Frosler scored a stunner after the visitors failed to clear a Nkosingiphile Ngcobo corner kick. However, after the interval, Kaitano Tembo's charges piled pressure and were eventually rewarded. Bradley Grobler slotted in a penalty to level matters after Anthony Aggay was judged to have tugged Thamsanqa Gabuza's jersey.
