Communities are fearing the worst for the people who are missing. In Kanyamazane, a man was swept away by floods, along with his house. Three days later, his family was desperate.
Their call was heeded and a prayer service was held before the search. A tractor was used to search the muddy area where he was last seen but these efforts were in vain. While his family was left inconsolable, another mission began for an unidentified man who tried to cross a river during a storm.
Captain Karel "Pottie" Potgieter from SAPS Inland Water-Policing & Diving Services said, "when they got to the river the person behind him told him not to cross and to find another path. The man insisted he would make it but when he tried to cross, the current washed him away."
  
Noluthando Maluku said, "some children from this side have to cross here to go to school on the other side and even shops are that side. There is one bridge far from here."
During the search, the missing man is not found. Mpumalanga has recorded eight fatalities while five people remain missing. Potgieter pleaded with residents, "please look after your children and don't let them swim in these rivers. Also, if you do have to cross a stream please make sure that there are people with you who can report if something goes wrong."
  
Mpumalanga's Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane will be visiting affected areas on Monday.
