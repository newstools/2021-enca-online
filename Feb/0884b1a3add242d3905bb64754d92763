Juventus move five points behind leaders Inter Milan, who beat Fiorentina 2-0 on Friday, with a game in hand. Ronaldo put Juventus ahead on 13 minutes with his 16th league goal of the campaign to extend his lead as Serie A's top scorer this term ahead of Inter's Romelu Lukaku. The Portuguese striker, who scored a double in the Italian Cup in midweek against Inter, ended his three-match league run without a goal. The five-time Ballon d'Or winner missed other chances as he was denied by the crossbar in the 23rd minute and Roma goalkeeper Pau Lopez seven minutes before the break. Juventus's second goal came 20 minutes from time when Roger Ibanez turned into his own net while trying to stop Ronaldo getting to a Dejan Kulusevski cross. "We'd prepared for this sort of game," said coach Andrea Pirlo, whose side drew 2-2 with Roma the last time the teams met. "In the reverse fixture, Roma employed the same tactic against us and this time we wanted to turn the game on its head tactically. "Morale is high. Defensively we're strong and we're more alert than we were before."
