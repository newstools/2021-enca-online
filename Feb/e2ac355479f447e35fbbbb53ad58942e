It's like something out of a movie. CCTV footage recorded a gang of thieves entering a car dealership and then going on the rampage, damaging luxury cars. Ayesha Ismail reports. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Cape Town police are still searching for a group of about 40 people who brazenly damaged eight luxury cars and assaulted staff at the upmarket car dealership, The Toy Shop. The masked men, who arrived in two Toyota Quantums and a bakkie, also took computers, cellphones and other personal belongings from staff members. Shocked staff did not want to speak on camera. They say the attack happened at around noon on Wednesday. First, two men casually walked in and asked for two vehicles.
