Cape Winelands Fire Services' Heinrich Louw said, "at this point in time, the fire is still burning out control and burning over an extensive area that spans from the Berg River Dam to Jonkershoek. Unfortunately at this point, the fire is still out of control." "At the moment we predict there are about 10 000 hectares of land that burnt down, land and also vegetation, of course. Yesterday <Friday> was quite hectic, we had to evacuate and relocate a number of residents, we also had a very unfortunate incident, we had damage to properties - but luckily for us, nobody got hurt, there was no fatalities." "Two firefighters sustained second-degree burns, but they were taken to Mediclinic and they were treated there. Currently, we have just over 230 people that are attending to this fire." Louw said the wind is a concern for the firefighters and anticipated the fire would be extinguished in approximately two days.
