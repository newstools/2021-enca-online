Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize announced last week – that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine would be arriving soon. One million doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine arrived two weeks ago. READ: South Africa's COVID-19 infections increase by 1,744 But it doesn’t have enough efficacy against mild to moderate illness of the COVID-19 variant discovered in the country.

Eastern Cape is still to identify and train 571 inoculators. Meanwhile, in Gauteng, 700 healthcare workers have so far been trained.
