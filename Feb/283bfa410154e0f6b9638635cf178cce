Australia named their squad last week. AFP/William West MELBOURNE - Australia pulled out of their Test cricket tour to South Africa due to the "unacceptable" risk to players with the coronavirus rampant in the country. Justin Langer's men were due to play three Tests against the Proteas, and Australia named their squad last week with the intent to fly out this month. With almost 1.5 million detected infections and more than 44,000 fatalities, South Africa has the highest number of cases and deaths on the continent.

"It has become clear that travelling from Australia to South Africa at this current time poses an unacceptable level of health and safety risk to our players, support staff and the community," he said. "This decision has not been made lightly and we are extremely disappointed, especially given the importance of continuing international cricket at this time.

There are currently no contingencies in place for the tour, although Hockley suggested the Tests could be played at a later date. "We look forward to playing the series against CSA at a date to be confirmed in due course," he said. The tour was originally scheduled for February and March.
