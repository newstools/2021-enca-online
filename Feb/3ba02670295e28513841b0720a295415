The Academy Awards in recent decades have taken place at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, but with the United States' second-largest city still under COVID-19 restrictions, the ceremony is "adapting to the requirements of the pandemic," said a spokesperson.

As far back as 1953 -- the first time the ceremony was televised -, proceedings were split between Los Angeles and New York. This year, other award shows are already experimenting with multiple locations including this month's Golden Globes. The Globes will see a "first-ever bicoastal telecast" in which Tina Fey hosts from New York's Rainbow Room and Amy Poehler from the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles, organisers said.
