The country suspended its vaccine rollout -- which was meant to begin with the AstraZeneca shots earlier month -- after a study found the jab failed to prevent mild and moderate illness caused by a new variant discovered in South Africa.

"There will be no wasteful and fruitless expenditure." The country had secured a million doses of the vaccine from the Serum Institute of India and was set to receive an additional consignment of 500,000.
