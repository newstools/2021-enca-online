Power cuts will now happen in two-hour chunks instead of four hours. While this might sound like good news, it just means you’ll have blackouts more frequently, though for shorter periods. READ: Eskom to implement stage 2 load-shedding The problem is, many electricity users weren’t informed and were taken by surprise when they discovered there was a new schedule. Residents of Johannesburg, in particular, seemed to have no idea what was happening. Eskom spokesperson Sikonathi Mantshantsha said there will naturally be teething problems with the schedule. "There is still cooperation and work to make sure the schedules are harmonised so there is still some confusion about the schedule,” he said. READ: City Power implements two-hour load-shedding City Power admits it needs to work with Eskom to sort out its new schedule. “The problem is that we have not fetched the blocks for Stage 2. So what we wanted to do was to engage Eskom further to communicate workshop and also talk to our customers," City Power's Isaac Mangena said. "This is a major decision. We wanted to make sure we do this correctly.” Eskom said it will announce whether or not there will be load-shedding in the coming week, soon. - eNCA’s Heidi Giokos reports.
