AFP/Nick Agro LOS ANGELES - Gina Carano, star of the hit Star Wars TV series "The Mandalorian," has been dropped by Lucasfilm after sharing "abhorrent" social media posts on topics, including the Holocaust. The departure of former mixed martial arts fighter Carano -- who has long stoked controversy with outspoken political views -- follows an online #FireGinaCarano campaign, but has also drawn accusations of "cancel culture" from her defenders. "Gina Carano is not currently employed by Lucasfilm and there are no plans for her to be in the future," a Lucasfilm spokesperson said in a statement to AFP. "Nevertheless, her social media posts denigrating people based on their cultural and religious identities are abhorrent and unacceptable." Carano's character Cara Dune, a female warrior, had appeared in seven "Mandalorian" episodes across two seasons -- only the show's titular star, played by Pedro Pascal, featured more. With Dune still alive at the end of season two, and a recently announced "Rangers of the New Republic" spinoff rumoured to feature the character, too, Carano's removal was seen as a welcome U-turn by some fans. Carano has also shared misinformation about mask-wearing and voter fraud. According to trade website Deadline, Carano has also "parted ways" with giant Hollywood talent agency UTA. Neither Carano's representatives nor UTA immediately responded to AFP's request for comment.
