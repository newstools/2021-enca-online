A nurse who works in a maternity ward at a hospital in Khayelitsha township in Cape Town was the first to be immunised, hours after the first batch of 80,000 doses landed in the country on Tuesday. Nurse Zoliswa Gidi-Dyosi looked relaxed as she received the jab, which was broadcast on live television.

He was upbeat that the rollout will be "flawless". "This is a new era for us." The new vaccines, only recently approved by the national health authorities, were distributed toÂ vaccination centres overnight. The stock is part of a consignment of nine million doses that South Africa secured from the American pharmaceutical giant.
