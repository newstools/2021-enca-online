Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Basic Education Department got the green light to release the 2020 matric exam results. Quality assurance body Umalusi says the leaking of two papers was not widespread. Maths Paper Two and Physical Science Paper Two were leaked hours before they were supposed to be written. READ: Umalusi approves release of 2020 exam results Umalusi's John Volmink said the executive committee of council approved the release of the DBE results of the November 2020 NSC examinations. “Where there has been unauthorised access to the papers and where there is evidence beyond being a passive recipient of the papers, the results of the candidates should be blocked pending investigations,” he said. “Umalusi can still nullify the certificates of candidates who are found guilty having benefited from the leaking of the papers, even after their results have been released.” The Department of Basic Education has welcomed Umalusi’s announcement. READ: 2020 matric exams were not compromised, Dept of Basic Education Basic Education spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said: “We come from a very difficult few months marred with a whole range of challenges that threatened the integrity and credibility of the examination today, it comes as great news to the department.” Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga will announce the matric results next Monday.
