Gontse Mathebula was walking to a nearby spaza shop when police started shooting at suspected hijackers. One suspect was shot dead while the other fled on foot and the little boy was hit by a stray bullet on his thigh. The boy's uncle Terrence Mathebula had to carry him to the local clinic where it was confirmed that he was shot in the left thigh.

"Well, it's unfortunate that people think the police are lying," said Mathapelo Peters, Gauteng police spokesperson. "Our statements are based on preliminary information at the crime scene. And in this case, that is what happened."
It's not the first time such an incident has occurred in Alexandra.
