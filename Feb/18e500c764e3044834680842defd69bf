Montjane is now the proud owner of a lighter, more improved wheelchair that will put her on par with some of the world’s best. “I’m just grateful to MacSteel for pulling through for me because I wasn’t really sure if I would get another chair after four years, because normally these chairs, they last for a period of four years, so I’m really really grateful that this happened just before Paralympics,” says Montjane A mainstay in the top 10 of the ITF’s wheelchair standings, the lighter chair could help give the world number five a further push up the rankings. “It really means there’s room for improvement. As I mentioned that this is one of the top tier wheelchairs that the best in the world are using, so I’m very much hopeful that it will assist me to do better on court,” she says. With one eye on a fourth Paralympic Games in August, the 34-year-old and her team already have plans to incorporate the newcomer into the training schedule. “It's quite a good addition to the team," says Monjane's coach, Siya Nkachela. "We call it 'The Beast', because we're going on beast mode now," he says. I have always put in 100% effort in my game. I train hard & practice hard, the only differentiating factor has been my wheelchair. My opponents have always managed to turn quicker & get around the court faster. Now I am finally at a par in terms of equipment. #Macsteel pic.twitter.com/j6qUfQAvlf
