AlphaTauri's Yuki Tsunoda wants to be the first Japanese driver to win a Grand Prix. AFP/Hamad Mohammed PARIS - AlphaTauri's new driver Yuki Tsunoda said that his ambition was to be "the first Japanese driver to win a race in Formula 1." The 20-year-old, who replaces the Russian Daniil Kvyat in the AlphaTauri stable, is the first Japanese driver to compete in Formula One since Kamui Kobayashi in 2014. The diminutive Tsunoda -- he is 1.59 metres tall -- was named FIA rookie of the year in December after finishing third in his debut season with British team Carlin in the Formula 2 championship. He has set his sights on making an even bigger impact in F1. "I just want to beat the other drivers and I also want to be the first Japanese driver to win a race in Formula 1," he told the team's website, adding that he recognises the big step-up in class from Formula 2. "The speed of the cars, of course, is a huge difference but also the fact that the season is much longer," he said. "On a technical side, there are many differences and it’s quite a big step up. The team is so much larger (so) there are a lot more engineers to report to. "In addition, it will also be necessary for me to remain well trained and strong, both physically and mentally, to cover 23 races with minimal down time -– this will also be a big difference from F2." Tsunoda, who is backed by the junior programme of AlphaTauri's engine supplier Honda, joins Frenchman Pierre Gasly at the Italian team. "Pierre is really fast and already has a win under his belt in F1," said Tsunoda. "The first target for every driver is to beat your teammate but he will be a hard one to beat. He’s an incredible talent."
