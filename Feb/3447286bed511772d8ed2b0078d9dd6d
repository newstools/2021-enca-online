YouTube, the video-sharing platform owned by Google, will introduce new ways for parents to control the content viewed by their children, even if they are too old for the YouTube Kids service. AFP/Martin Bureau SAN FRANCISCO - YouTube said it will roll out new accounts that let tweens or young teens explore the streaming video service within boundaries set by their parents. An early version of the offering will be released in coming months, letting parents use Google accounts to provide children YouTube access that comes with content and feature constraints, according to kids and family product management director James Beser. The move responds to concerns about violence and other inappropriate content which may be viewed by minors on the massive video-sharing platform.

"We are announcing a new choice for parents who have decided their tweens and teens are ready to explore YouTube with a supervised account." An "explore" option for parental control settings will feature videos considered suitable for children ages 9 and older, such as tutorials, gaming videos, music clips, news and educational content.

A "most of YouTube" setting will open viewing to a gamut of content on the global video sharing platform except for content that is age-restricted or involving sensitive topics only appropriate for older audiences. "We know that every parent has a different parenting style and that every child is unique and reaches different developmental stages at different times," Beser said.

"We will use a mix of user input, machine learning and human review to determine which videos are included," Beser said. "We know that our systems will make mistakes and will continue to evolve over time." Google-owned YouTube started out as a video-sharing platform for people at least 13 years of age but added a YouTube Kids option in 2015 with parental controls on content.
