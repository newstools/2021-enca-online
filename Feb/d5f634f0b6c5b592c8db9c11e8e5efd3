Courtesy of #DStv403 DURBAN - They are meant to serve and protect, but what happens when law enforcement officers are the ones society need protection from? eThekwini Metro Police are in hot water following reports of widespread corruption and errant behaviour. The police have been accused of misconduct, ranging from the appointments of friends to the personal use of EMPD vehicles and even the release of impounded cars without payment.
A leaked forensic investigation report has detailed how EMPD officers have abused the city's fleet and how nepotism is rife within the metro police department. READ: Hawks swoop on eThekwini fraudsters Metro Police, however, say the report by city's Integrity and Investigations Unit is illegal.
"The problem with getting civilian investigators investigating police is that there is information," said EMPD Deputy Commissioner Sbonelo Mchunu. "Give us evidence of a constable while on or off duty abusing a vehicle going to buy booze, let us as the police deal with that constable or if it's me, get Ipid to deal with me." READ: Hawks make more corruption-related arrests in eThekwini The EMPD says the majority of allegations against it aren't new and that it has already accounted to the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) and the previous eThekwini Administration. The eThekwini Municipality says the matter is receiving urgent attention internally. * eNCA's Mawande Kheswa reports.
