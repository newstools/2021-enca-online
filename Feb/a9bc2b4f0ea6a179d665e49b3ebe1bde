AFP/Phill Magakoe GENEVA - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a global plan to vaccinate against COVID-19, warning that inequities in initial efforts risked both the world's health and economy. Opening a special Security Council session on vaccines held at the level of foreign ministers, Guterres warned that just 10 nations have administered 75 percent of the doses so far -- and 130 countries have had no vaccinations at all.

He said the Group of 20 major economies was in the best position to set up a task force on financing and implementation of global vaccinations and offered full support of the United Nations.
