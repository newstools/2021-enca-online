Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A film about a family’s displacement from District Six in Cape Town has scooped an international award. District Six Rising From The Dust won a Florence Film Award for Best Original Story. The win came on the eve of the commemoration of 55 years since the area was declared a whites-only area. The movie tells the story of the forced removal of the family of filmmaker Weaam Williams from District Six in Cape Town and their restitution journey. WATCH: Redeveloping District Six “My film is inextricably linked to the cause of the return of the people to the land," Williams said. "This is what District Six Rising From The Dust is about, it’s about rising, the story of District Six rising from the dust.” Williams is currently working on two projects: A documentary about the historic neighbourhood of Bo-Kaap located in the inner city and a screenplay for a feature film. * eNCA's Monique Mortlock reports.
