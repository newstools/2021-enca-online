This after the lead prosecutor was arrested for shoplifting. North West NPA head of commercial crime, Jeanette Neveling, was arrested for shoplifting clothing and groceries from Woolworths. She has since been released on R500 bail, and will appear in court again in march. Nelson, however, returns to court on Monday on charges of fraud relating to the irregular appointment of a senior official. The Women's League says a delay in the case will amount to a denial of justice.
