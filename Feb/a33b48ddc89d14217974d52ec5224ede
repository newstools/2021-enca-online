It started as a joke at the beginning of the lockdown, but now Dot McCarthy from Cronkshaw Fold Farm has made a successful business from hiring her goats to appear on Zoom calls. For a small fee, anyone who wants to spice up an online work or family meeting can invite a goat to participate in it. from Cronkshaw Fold Farm LONDON - A British farmer came up with a jokey idea to rent out her goats to liven up video call meetings -- and found an unexpected source of lockdown income. The floppy-eared goats glance curiously as farmer Dot McCarthy holds up a mobile phone to film them eating hay and prancing around in a barn. The video of the goats appears on a Zoom call as three other participants smile and McCarthy tells them the goats' names. Customers have their choice of seven different goats on the farm's website, from "highest-ranking nanny" Margaret to cute brown-and-white kid Lulu. "Say you're doing a video call with work or whatever, or maybe a really long family call and it's getting a bit boring," McCarthy says. "You can book a goat to join you in the meeting and just see if any of your colleagues notice." And business is thriving, the 32-year-old farmer says. "This started as a joke -- putting goats on video calls to prank people in their work routines -- and it's just gone a bit crackers, really." Since it started offering the service nearly a year ago, the farm has earned £50,000 pounds, "which is crazy", she adds.
