"Our problem is that [while] there is a search-and-rescue operation under way, it's an operation where they are depending on ordinary workers to do the rescuing. "Workers decided to volunteer themselves because management, in their view, was not doing enough. What is needed here is external support," she said. "The problem is that this building has collapsed on top of another building and the area is very unstable."
