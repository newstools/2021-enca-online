Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - The decision to move Transnet’s Head Offices from Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth is economic sabotage. That's the word from KwaZulu-Natal’s government and the local business community. They believe they’re being robbed of opportunities and should have been consulted. READ: State capture inquiry hears Transnet related evidence The Durban Chamber of Commerce says at least there should’ve been consultations. "The least that Transnet should have done was to actually just consult with the stakeholders and say this is the plan that we have and also share the reasoning of making such a decision," said Palesa Phili, Durban Chamber CEO. "We [are] really failing to understand the business sense and the business logic to have made such a decision." READ: Transnet executive continues testimony at state capture inquiry The KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Government has also voiced its disappointment. "The hard facts of the matter which we would have hoped would have guided this decision is that two of the biggest ports in the country are situated in KZN," said Ravi Pillay, KZN Economic Development MEC. "60 percent of our import and export comes through the Durban Harbour so it makes absolutely sense for the headquarters [of the] Port Authority to be based in Durban." * eNCA's Thuba Vilane reports.
