Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba, says help is on the way. "I must admit that we've been having challenges, the issue is with people not being able to apply technology. We ended up having to give our nurses our own gadgets because you need an android phone. In the rural areas, they are using outdated cellphones that can't even share a whatsapp and it also doesn't have internet access and that kind of phones won't allow you to register. So what we've done, we've put up a team of IT to assist all of them to help them register. Also urging them to ask their kids to help them register," Ramathuba said.
