Visitors look at a version of 'The Last Supper' at The Louvre Museum. AFP/Lucas Barioulet MILAN - The Milan monastery housing Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" has reopened its doors, bringing delight and solace to locals who for once can visit the masterpiece without booking weeks ahead. Painted on the refectory wall of the Dominican monastery inside Santa Maria delle Grazie, The Last Supper attracted more than 445,000 visitors in 2019, lured to Milan for the 500th anniversary of the death of the great Renaissance painter and inventor. That, of course, was before coronavirus struck last year, tourism ground to a halt and annual revenues of 1.2 million euros fell by 80 percent, according to the Cenavolo Vinciano Museum, which operates the site.

The work -- described by the 16th century painter and art historian Giorgio Vasari as "a beautiful and marvellous thing" -- portrays Christ's last meal with his twelve apostles, capturing the moment when he predicts Judas' upcoming betrayal.

Instead, his experiment using oil and tempera paint on top of a dry foundation achieved a brilliant lustre, but it soon began flaking and showing signs of damp. The Cenavolo Vinciano reopened its doors this week after being closed since November when Italy began new restrictions to counter a second wave of the virus.
