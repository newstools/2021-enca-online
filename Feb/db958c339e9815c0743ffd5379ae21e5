Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - The National Driving Association of South Africa is adamant that the online booking system needs to be scrapped. In a bid to get government's attention, driving schools shut down several license testing centres across Gauteng on Friday. Driving schools say the Transport Department is not taking their demands seriously. WATCH: National Driving Schools Association unhappy with online booking “We submitted a memorandum of demands to the department. We were then promised feedback," said Moss Letsholo, NDSASA spokesperson. "After seven days we were shown a presentation selling the system to us. It was supposed to have been sold before it was implemented. We fell that we are being taken for granted.” While protesters closed off the licensing centres, some were left out in the cold. The Transport Department is yet to respond to the demands. * eNCA's Nkosazana Dambuza reports.
