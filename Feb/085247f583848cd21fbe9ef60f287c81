Dirco Director-General Kgabo Mahoai. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor has slapped her Director-General Kgabo Mahoai with a precautionary suspension. This follows a R118-million land acquisition that went sour in the United States. The purchased property was meant to be used by the South African Diplomatic Mission to the United Nations and the Consulate General in New York. A fact-finding mission by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation was unable to locate the property. Ambassador Nonceba Losi Tutu has since been appointed acting Director-General pending the investigation.
