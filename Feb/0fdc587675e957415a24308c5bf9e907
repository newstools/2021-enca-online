File: England paceman James Anderson. BackpagePix/PA/Anthony Devlin LONDON - James Anderson says he is "not assuming anything" as England contemplate resting their star bowler for the second Test against India despite his match-winning performance in the series opener. The paceman took three wickets in a superb spell of reverse-swing bowling in Chennai on Tuesday as England won by 227 runs to go 1-0 up in the four-match series. The 38-year-old's fitness levels appear to be as good as at any time in his long career but Anderson may be left out for the second Test, also in Chennai, depriving him of the chance to add to his tally of 611 Test wickets -- a record for a fast bowler.

The tourists could stick to their policy of rotating Anderson with longstanding new-ball partner Stuart Broad, who missed the first Test but has been in fine form over the past 18 months. "When a batsman gets in rhythm and form, they want to keep batting and keep that rhythm going, and it's the same for a bowler," said Anderson.

So I'm not assuming anything." England coach Chris Silverwood admitted on Wednesday: "It is hard (to leave Anderson out), he is a class act. But you'll have to wait and see. "I'm not reluctant to change a winning team now if it's the best thing to do for the players, the team and the longevity of it." England will play in front of a crowd for the first time since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, with up to 15,000 fans a day allowed into the M. A. Chidambaram Stadium.
