Focusing on income and employment, the survey looks at how COVID-19 has impacted South African households. The first survey found that around 2.8-million people lost their jobs over the lockdown period.

The second survey showed that the numbers had not changed from April to June, despite the easing of the lockdown over the period.
The latest survey has shown a positive turn, with around 2,1 million jobs returned.

The rate of households experiencing hunger hit a high of 23 percent in May and June. That was after the country's first and most severe lockdown. It improved to 16 percent in July/August as lockdown eased and welfare payments arrived, but deteriorated again over the second half of the year. The survey's most worrying finding is that child hunger is now at its highest level in 10 years.
