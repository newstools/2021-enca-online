File: Former Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - Malusi Gigaba has responded to the State Capture Commission's request for him to appear in tweets on Thursday.
The former Home Affairs Minister tweeted that he is to appear at the inquiry from 8 to 12 March. READ: Public Protector finds against Gigaba on Gupta citizenship He further says that the state is refusing to pay R1-million to his lawyers that they allegedly need for him to appear. Earlier this week, the Public Protector's office made findings against Gigaba over the early naturalisation certificates granted to the Guptas. DCJ Raymond Zondo says I must appear before him, from 8 to 12 March, presumably to help him separate fact from fiction.
But his secretariat has, so far, ignored my requests to cross-examine those who’ve told unsubstantiated fabrications & self-serving distortions about me...1/2 2/2... And the state I was serving, the state which is spending R1bn on his commission, is refusing to pay the R1mil my lawyers need in order to help me prepare for my appearance.
I’ll, however, be appearing before His Lordship. This notwithstanding. Even if it costs me my home.
