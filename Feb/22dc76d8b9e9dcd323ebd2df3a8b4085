President Cyril Ramaphosa. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa is urging those with evidence of wrongdoing by any judge to come forward and report the matter. In his weekly letter, Ramaphosa is slamming those who attack the judiciary without any evidence. Some judges have been accused of pursuing interests other than the cause of justice and others have been accused of accepting bribes. The president says these claims are disturbing and if they're found to be true, it means some are failing to adhere to their constitutional duty. But he says there must be evidence to support the claims and they must be referred to the relevant authorities to investigate. If this is not done, then he says the allegations can be seen as nothing more than an attempt to undermine the judiciary and its function in our democracy. We should not take attacks on the judiciary lightly. Such attacks shake the very foundations of our constitutional democracy. Unless supported by evidence, such claims undermine confidence in our courts, and weaken our Constitutional order. https://t.co/og9fbwyt0E pic.twitter.com/fHGk2VYUNA
