Now, she can afford to help former president Jacob Zuma feed scores of visitors to his Nkandla home.

"It's a great honour and pleasure for me to have known you, for a number of years of over two decades or so," Myeni told Zuma. "I see people are coming in large numbers, but what I've been observing as a woman is that you continue to dine with them and you still are happy to host people as you always say that you love people and it shows in how you interact with them."
