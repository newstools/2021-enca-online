Robert Lewandowski (3rd L) celebrates scoring for Bayern Munich against Cologne on Saturday. AFP/Kerstin Joensson LONDON - Robert Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry both scored twice as Bayern Munich romped to a 5-1 win at home to Cologne on Saturday to open up a five-point lead at the top of the Bundesliga. Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting headed Bayern into an early lead before Lewandowski, the league's top scorer, struck twice to increase his league tally to 28 goals this season. Gnabry came off the bench to claim two late goals behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena on his first appearance since tearing a thigh muscle in Bayern's Club World Cup final win in Qatar. Second-placed RB Leipzig can trim Bayern's lead later at home to Borussia Moenchengladbach.
