James Lowe's disallowed try in the 15-13 Six Nations defeat by France proved a pivotal moment. AFP/Brian Lawless DUBLIN - Ireland winger James Lowe says he is making progress on his defence despite twice being at fault for crucial tries as his side slipped to consecutive opening defeats for the first time in Six Nations history. The 28-year-old New Zealand-born wing failed to prevent French full-back Brice Dulin delivering the pass that let in Damian Penaud for France's second try in their 15-13 victory on Sunday. The week before he had been criticised for his failure to cover opposite wing Louis Rees-Zammit for his try in Wales's 21-16 win. The Leinster star has been the butt of some stinging remarks, no more so than former England wing Chris Ashton who said last year he was "too big, too heavy, too slow." However, Lowe does not shrink from addressing his critics. "Critics, they're going to talk anyway, that's their job," he said after the France game. "There's 99 percent of people who talk that I don't listen to because they have never set foot in Lansdowne Road in a game. "I worked on it so hard during the week, I was obviously highly frustrated last week, ball in hand, that's my natural game, it's the defence that I need to get better at and that's what I work on." Lowe's powerful kicks have rescued the Irish on several occasions but he admits he needs to work on his tackling. "I just have to make sure I can nail on the defence," he said. "Today was a good shift, unfortunately I got that hit on that one tackle that he managed to bounce off but if people don't think I'm going in the right direction they're not watching the right footy, are they?"
