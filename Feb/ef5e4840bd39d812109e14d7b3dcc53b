Spain's Rafael Nadal hits a return against Michael Mmoh of the US during their men's singles match on day four of the Australian Open tennis tournament. AFP/Brandon Malone MELBOURNE -Â Rafael Nadal laughed off a gesticulating heckler as he brushed aside Michael Mmoh and continued his quest for history at the Australian Open on Thursday. Nadal, who has complained of a bad back as he seeks a record 21st Grand Slam title, swept past America's 177th-ranked Mmoh 6-1, 6-4, 6-2. A female spectator interrupted the match late in the second set, shouting and giving Nadal the middle finger before she was ejected -- and the Spaniard immediately fired two aces for a 2-0 sets lead. "No, and honestly I don't want to," said a smiling Nadal, when asked if he knew the heckler. "For me it was funny, somebody doing the finger to me. I don't know the reason, but I was surprised. But at the same time, I was thinking, poor girl. Because probably she was drunk or something." Next up for the Spaniard, who is attempting to overtake the injury-sidelined Roger Federer and become the first man to win 21 major crowns, is Britain's Cameron Norrie.
