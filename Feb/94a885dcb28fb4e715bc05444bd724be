Prince Harry AFP/Adrian Dennis LONDON - Prince Harry formally settled a libel claim against the publisher of The Mail On Sunday and MailOnline website over reports he snubbed soldiers after stepping down as a senior royal. Harry sued Associated Newspapers over reports published in October that he had "not been in touch" with soldiers since his last appearance as an honorary Marine in March. But the Mail On Sunday printed an apology in December and made a donation to the prince's charity after accepting Harry had in fact contacted the Royal Marines.

The prince "made repeated and concerted efforts to support the Royal Marines and other members of the armed forces and their families in the past year, even though he was required to step back from formal military roles", said his lawyer Jenny Afia. Judge Matthew Nicklin heard details of the settlement at a remote hearing on Monday.
