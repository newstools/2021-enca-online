Ireland's Garry Ringrose got the first of six tries for Ireland. AFP/Filippo Monteforte DUBLIN - Ireland got their first Six Nations win this campaign with a 48-10 victory over Italy as the hosts fell to their 30th consecutive defeat in the tournament. Tries from Garry Ringrose, Hugo Keenan and Will Connors lifted the Irish 27-10 at half-time. CJ Stander, Connors, Keith Earls added three more after the break for a bonus-point win for the Irish who had lost their opening two games against France and Wales. Captain Johnny Sexton marked his return with 18 points on the day in the Stadio Olimpico. "Thankfully we got victory we were desperate for," said Sexton. "Some brilliant stuff, especially in first half, I thought we were outstanding. "It doesn't mean we're fixed, we have to keep improving, it's a massive test in Murrayfield (against Scotland) and six-day turnaround and then against England."

Johan Meyer had revived Azzurri hopes just before the break with a try which Garbisi converted for their only points of the day. Italy's six-year drought continued as Franco Smith's side are without a win in the tournament since beating Scotland in Murrayfield back in 2015. The Azzurri have not beaten Ireland since 2013 with Irish trio Iain Henderson, Dave Kilcoyne and Cian Healy the only survivors of that clash on duty on Saturday. "Today we weren't at the same level as Ireland," admitted Smith whose side have conceded 139 points and 19 tries in their last three matches. "It's really hard. All of Italy are waiting for a win, and we're fighting all the time to give them one."
