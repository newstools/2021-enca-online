File: Police Minister Bheki Cele. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - Police Minister, Bheki Cele, says South Africans are out to kill. He was speaking to eTV's Annika Larsen last night about the 6.6 percent increase in murders. "To give the facts to say one would know why, would not be giving the actual understanding why people would kill people in this way in such a short time, in 3 months. People die in the hands of people they know. A large number of people die in their private homes… most people are killed through the firearms rather than any other weapon which tells you that South Africans are out there to murder other people," said Cele.
