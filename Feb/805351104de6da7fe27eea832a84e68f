Organisers are giving cyclists the opportunity to compete in some form of the tour. One being virtual, and the other on the road. Cyclists worldwide will have to wait for the pomp and ceremony of the Cape Town Cycle Tour. Usually held early in the year it has not decided yet whether or not to host the event later this year. "We've put together a COVID compliant Cycle Tour for October," says director David Bellairs. "It's a vastly reduced Cycle Tour, so it will be permitted to participate. It's a rolling start with a rolling finish," he says.

For those looking to cycle in March, all is not lost. "The first opportunity was the Virtual Cape Town Cycle Tour. Which is actually ridden on a smart trainer in your own home where you link through an application to a video where you are riding, physically riding while you are on your bike at home, riding along the route of the Cycle Tour," says Bellairs. "The perspective that you see is filmed from a bicycle," he adds. Benefactors of the race will be pleased with the efforts of the Cycle tour. For more, watch the video above
