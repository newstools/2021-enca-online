Disgruntled residents gatecrashed a new housing development on Wednesday. They say the City of Cape Town is going against a court ruling of giving preference to outsiders as beneficiaries of the new housing development. The R34-million project was completed in September 2018, but the city’s plans to hand over houses has been disrupted by ongoing protests.

READ: Human Settlements department to investigate housing project "It's a very challenging matter primarily because of our backlog versus what we can deliver as the city, there's a huge gap... we have a backlog that is more than 30,000," Booi said. "We can only build so much per year. I do understand the frustration, everyone is longing to have a roof over their heads. "Many people have been waiting too long. But because resources are limited we are unable to deliver at the speed that we are expected to by communities. We are trying to engage with communities to make sure that we can find an amicable solution to this problem." The City of Cape Town says it hopes to hand over 71 homes in Morningstar by the end of the week.
