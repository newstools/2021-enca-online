Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Over 400 pupils from Forest Village in Eerste River in Cape Town are studying under trees instead of physical classrooms. This is because their parents are demanding an isiXhosa-medium school be built in the area. But the provincial education department says it can’t afford to do so, leaving the pupils in the lurch. Parents say the children were moved from informal settlements in Khayelitsha, Nyanga and Gugulethu. Now, they’re in a bind. They can’t afford to transport their children back to the schools where they were initially enrolled. The provincial education department says it has made several attempts to transport the children to nearby schools, but says their parents refused. It believes those pushing for a new school to be built want employment. The department says it will continue encouraging parents to enrol their children back into the schools they previously attended but is adamant it won’t be adding another school in the area. * eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
