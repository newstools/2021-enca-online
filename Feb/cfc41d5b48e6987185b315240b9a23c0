The detonator button was pressed shortly after 9am, reducing the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino to a pile of rubble in just a few seconds. The casino had been closed since 2014. AFP/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images Closed since 2014, the casino was Trump's first property in the US coastal gambling town in which he came to own several properties. It opened in 1984 and has undergone little to no maintenance since shuttering. On several occasions during storms, pieces of its exterior have fallen onto the seaside promenade that runs alongside the building. Since 2016, the two-building complex has belonged to billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who was one of Trump's main Atlantic City financiers.

Icahn has not said what he will do with the land once the building is destroyed. Trump had already filed a lawsuit in 2014 asking that his name be removed from the building's facade, believing its presence there was bad for the Trump name and brand.
