A group calling itself “We Are More” gathered on Fish Hoek beach, calling for an end to lockdown. READ: Mask laws 'not an idle threat' Many of the protesters attended last week’s demonstration at Muizenberg to call for the reopening of beaches. A man, one of the organisers of the "We Are More" protest, calling for an end to the national lockdown, was arrested, after assaulting eNCA reporter Monique Mortlock and attempting to pull her mask from her face. “I am totally against the mask. I’m totally against the lockdown. I’m totally against the corrupt government, I mean they are telling us what to do…they’re telling us what to do but they are the ones that should be arrested,” a protestor said. The protest continued with law enforcement keeping a close watch.

Organisers of the march have since released a statement condemning the incident and apologising to the eNCA journalist. *Watch an interview with eNCA reporter Monique Mortlock and Duduzile Ramela above.
