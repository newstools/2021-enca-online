JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize and a team of experts are held a briefing to give an important update on  COVID-19 vaccines. The briefing comes, as Wits University says efforts are underway to develop a new generation of jabs that will be more effective against the COVID-19 variant first identified here in South Africa. In a statement released this afternoon, the university says the Oxford University - AstraZeneca vaccine provides minimal protection against mild and moderate cases of the 501y.v2 variant. This is the same vaccine that arrived in South Africa at the beginning of the month, and is due to be administered to health care workers in the next few days.
