Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the expiry date of the AstraZeneca was not discovered by accident. He was speaking during a public briefing on Covid-19 vaccination plans. The rollout of the vaccine is on hold after it was found to be less effective against the variant of the virus prevalent in South Africa. Mkhize says they will now use the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, and health workers are still first in line for the shots.

But should the doses not be used on time, they will be swapped before they expire. The minister also indicated that South Africa and other African countries have the capacity to produce their own vaccines. At the same time, he says government will cover the cost of vaccines for those who do not have medical aid.
