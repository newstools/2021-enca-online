AFP/Andy Rain LONDON - England have recalled George Ford at fly-half for Saturday's Six Nations clash against Italy at Twickenham, with captain Owen Farrell moving to inside centre. Leicester outside-half Ford was on the bench for last weekend's shock home loss to Scotland, with Farrell starting at No 10 instead. But the Saracens star was widely criticised for his performance as reigning champions England opened their Six Nations title defence with a lacklustre 11-6 Calcutta Cup defeat.

Farrell's performance led some pundits to suggest coach Eddie Jones should drop his skipper, but instead, he has reverted to a familiar 10-12 combination by including the 73-times capped Ford in his starting line-up. The unlucky Lawrence was dropped entirely from the matchday 23, despite having to wait until the 63rd minute to make his first carry against the Scots.

England have never lost to Italy, who suffered their 28th successive Six Nations defeat against all opponents when they were hammered 50-10 by France in Rome last week.
