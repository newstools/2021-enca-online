File: Caf has given Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns' opponents an ultimatum to provide neutral venues for their fixtures. BackpagePix/Muzi Ntombela JOHANNESBURG - Caf has given Kaizer Chiefs and Mamelodi Sundowns' opponents an ultimatum to provide neutral venues for their fixtures. This despite Safa making its stance clear on the matter this week, saying South African clubs will not play in neutral venues. It suggests, should Wydad be unable to honour the fixture, a 2-0 win should be declared for Amakhosi. This after Chiefs' clash with Morocco's Wydad Casablanca was delayed three times over COVID-19 restrictions. Meanwhile, Sundowns were barred from travelling to Algeria for the same reason. The Brazilians were set to play CR Belouizdad and they could also receive three points from the Algerian side.
