Former President Jacob Zuma says he will defy a Constitutional Court order and refuse to appear before the commission. He says he's not afraid of being arrested, convicted, or imprisoned by a democratic government behaving like the Apartheid regime. Michael Appel is following the proceedings. #eNCA​ Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The state capture inquiry has heard how -- despite adverse findings by the Auditor-General and Standing Committee on Public Accounts, Ministers or Directors-General, who repeatedly flouted procurement policies -- faced no sanctions. The inquiry's new focus for the week is Parliamentary oversight. First to the stand on this matter was former Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) chairperson, Themba Godi. Godi says the Auditor-General and Scopa did its work year after year with little impact. “That sense of impunity is what emboldened the looters to continue as if they have a democratic right to be corrupt,” Godi said. Godi noticed a consistency under former presidents Thabo Mbeki and Jacob Zuma’s administrations. “The lack of responsiveness to the recommendations of Parliament from the executive was at the heart of it all. "The lack of political and administrative will to do what is right for the country to stop the looting of public funds.” In the main, Godi says ANC Parliamentarians fought factional battles, with no regard for their duty as public office bearers. “There were a lot of our colleagues in the portfolio committee who were actually an embarrassment to the notion of public representation and to oversight itself,” he said. Those from the majority party who did their oversight work a little too well, got booted. “I don’t know whether it is coincidence, but all Scopa members from the ANC were not returned to Parliament.” The inquiry continues with various portfolio committee members from the DA giving evidence. * eNCA's Michael Appel reports.
