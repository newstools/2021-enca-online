A recently conducted survey by all teacher unions raised concerns around PPE, lack of social distancing as well as basic services like water and electricity. Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga is expected to brief the nation on the readiness of schools on Sunday. Unions have also raised issues of counselling, as there are teachers who have lost loved ones during the pandemic. They say they have had these discussions with the department of basic education. "We have consistently raised these issues of basic education and we are getting a sense that they are aware of the particular need," says Sadtu spokesperson, Xolani Fakude.

According to Fakude, the union would suggest a greater collaboration with other departments that could assist, be they social development, the department of health or NGOs. The unions go on to say that teachers are said to be ready as they have been in the schooling environment for about two weeks. This follows the announcement that schools were meant to open on 25 January for teachers and 27 January for learners. However, that was then delayed by two weeks.
