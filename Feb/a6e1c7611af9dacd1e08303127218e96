Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Vaal River has been polluted beyond acceptable standards. That's the finding of the SA Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) following an investigation into the sewage that's been spilling into the river. It says the Vaal river must be declared critical infrastructure in order to protect it.

Furthermore, the river is said to pose a health hazard not fit human consumption. The sewage spills have also played a role in the decrease of tourism and recreational activities near the river, denting the area’s struggling economy.

The commission has asked for continued accountability, saying the municipality must hold officials responsible for wasteful expenditure. It now wants national government to consider intervening in the running of the ailing and cash-strapped Emfuleni Municipality. * eNCA's Nqobile Madlala reports.
