AFP/Carl Court LONDON - British bank Barclays announced a 38 percent slump in net profit for 2020 and said expenses related to the coronavirus pandemic were set to stay high this year. Profit after tax fell to £1.53-billion, Barclays said in a statement. Group credit impairment charges shot up to £4.8 billion from £1.9-billion owing "to the deterioration in the economic outlook driven by the COVID-19 pandemic", the bank said. Despite the tough year, "Barclays remains well capitalised, well-provisioned for impairments... with a strong balance sheet, and competitive market positions across the group", chief executive Jes Staley said in the statement.
