A group of South African doctors has launched an urgent court application. They're seeking easier access to ivermectin. Dr Naseeba Kathrada from the I can make a difference organisation, speaks more on this. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The jury is still out in terms of research around ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment but some believe it is urgently needed. A group of 55 doctors has launched an urgent court application to get easy access to ivermectin. They want to be able to prescribe it for COVID-19 patients, without having to go through the Section 21 process, which allows for compassionate use. READ: SAHPRA: Ivermectin 'doesn't help or harm' SAHPRA intends to oppose the application, set down for 22 February. One of the doctors, Naseeba Kathrada, says this process has failed dismally. "We understand that SAHPRA's main contention with this drug is that there isn't enough evidence for it to be used on the protocol and we understand that," Kathrada said. WATCH: Doctors can prescribe Ivermectin "In fact, we clarify that in our affidavit-we are not anti-vax. We are not against the vaccine and we are not asking for COVID-19 to be put on the COVID-19 protocol. "However, because of the issue with the registration lapsing etc. and SAHPRA banned the drug on the 22nd of December it is now illegal for a doctor to have possession of tablets to give to their patients, without a Section 21 application. "We've done due process like SAHPRA asked and we're saying it's a cumbersome procedure and it takes long and a doctor cannot be filling in a form that takes an hour when you are seeing 40 to 60 patients a day."
