Brown NEW YORK - Chris Harrison, the host of US reality TV dating show "The Bachelor," has announced he is stepping down after he was widely criticised for comments he made about race. Harrison said he had been wrong to defend a current contestant who had to apologise for attending a sorority party at a former slave plantation. "By excusing historical racism, I defended it," the 49-year-old wrote. "I invoked the term 'woke police,' which is unacceptable," he added. "I am ashamed over how uninformed I was. I was so wrong. To the Black community, to the BIPOC community: I am so sorry. My words were harmful," Harrison wrote, using an acronym for Black, Indigenous and people of colour. Harrison, who has hosted "The Bachelor" since 2002, said that after consultation with Warner Bros. and ABC he will be "stepping aside for a period of time." He added he would also not participate in the "After the Final Rose Special." "The Bachelor" centres on a single man selecting a potential spouse from a group of women who compete for his affections.
