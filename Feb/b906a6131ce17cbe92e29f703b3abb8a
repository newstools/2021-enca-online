AFP/Anne-Christine Poujoulat CAIRO - Denmark defeated Sweden 26-24 to win a second successive men's world handball title, with Mikkel Hansen grabbing seven goals and goalkeeper Niklas Landin pulling off a series of stunning saves. Olympic champions Denmark had defeated Norway to lift the 2019 trophy on home ground. While Hansen grabbed the scoring headlines, the Danes were equally indebted to Landin who made 15 saves. "It was Niklas Landin who made all the difference," Danish winger Emil Jakobsen told AFP. "He stopped everything in the last few minutes and it's thanks to those saves that we won." In the third-place play-off, Spain defeated seven-time world champions France 35-29.
