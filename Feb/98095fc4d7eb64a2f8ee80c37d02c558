Courtesy of #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Senior Parliamentary officials say it was not their job to report an alleged bribery incident involving MP Bongani Bongo to the police. Testifying in the Western Cape division of the High Court, both the Secretary of the National Council of Provinces Modibedi Phindela and the acting secretary to Parliament Penelope Tyawa backed up testimony from previous witnesses. EXCLUSIVE: Bongani Bongo refutes bribery claims Tyawa testified that as the legislature’s chief administrator, it's not up to her to get involved in the conduct of MPs. She handed an affidavit deposed by the evidence leader of Parliament’s Eskom Inquiry to the Speaker to act. The matter was then referred to Parliament’s Ethics Committee. On Friday, Bongo was met by several young Cosas and ANC supporters who travelled from his home province of Mpumalanga to support him.

"He is still our own. If the court finds him guilty, he’s still our own. If the court finds him guilty, he’s still our own but we will respect any decision by the court because this court is here to serve the people of the country.” The case resumes on Monday with two more witnesses still to be called by the state.
