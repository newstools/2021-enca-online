Former US President Donald Trump. AFP/Saul Loeb WASHINGTON - Lawyers for Donald Trump expect to take just a few hours to argue for acquittal in his impeachment trial, and President Joe Biden says he's "anxious" to see how Republicans will vote after searing testimony that the former president incited insurrection. "I'm just anxious to see what my Republican friends do, if they stand up," Biden said at the White House. So far, there is no sign that enough Republicans will join the Democrats to convict Trump, who retains heavy influence over the right-wing of the party after leaving office. READ: Trump impeachment in motion Democratic impeachment managers rested their case on Thursday after two days of often emotional presentations. But in a sign that they want to get to a Senate vote as quickly as possible, Trump's lawyers say they will use as little as three or four hours to state their own case, when under the rules they are allowed up to 16 hours. "There's no reason for us to be out there a long time. As I said from the start of this thing, this trial never should have happened," one of the lawyers, David Schoen, told Fox News. WATCH: Trump: Unpacking impeachment implications The impeachment team charged Trump with stoking an insurrection after losing re-election to Biden on 3 November. Impeachment managers insist that Trump, who has never expressed remorse for his encouragement of the violent crowd, is so dangerous he should be barred from holding office again. Biden said Thursday that evidence against his predecessor -- including grim, never before seen footage of the January 6 riot -- was so strong it could change "some minds" in the Senate. It would take a two-thirds majority to convict, meaning 17 Republicans would need to join the Senate's 50 Democrats. This is highly unlikely, but if even a handful of Republicans vote to convict, it would be a historic mark against Trump.
