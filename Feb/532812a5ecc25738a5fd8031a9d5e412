"Despite the difficult economic conditions linked to the coronavirus pandemic, the export levels seen in 2019, a record year, were once again surpassed," the organisation said in a statement. Last year, Switzerland exported over 77,100 tonnes of cheese, up 1.6 percent from 2019.

Exports of ready-to-use fondue cheese saw the biggest jump of 4.9 percent. "The closure of restaurants, people working from home, but also the restrictions on leisure activities have forced us to spend more time at home," the organisation's spokeswoman Christa Wettstein told AFP in an email.

Drinks and appetisers have also helped many get through the long months of pandemic restrictions, with cheese platters often an essential ingredient, she said.
