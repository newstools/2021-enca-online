File: A glass of red wine. AFP/Georges Gobet PARIS - French wine exports tumbled 11.3 percent last year to 8.2 billion euros as tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump sapped demand in France's top export market, the Federation of French Wines and Spirits Exporters (FEVS) said Thursday. Exports of French wines and spirits to the US dropped 18 percent to 3.1 billion euros after Trump imposed 25 percent import tariffs on many wines, cheeses, olives and other European delicacies in a battle over subsidies to EU planemaker Airbus. US imports of French wines alone were down by 400 million euros on the year.

"Our expectations were exceeded," he added, lamenting "an extremely unfavourable environment." The fallout from the trade war with the US was compounded by the Covid-19 pandemic that prompted many countries, including France, to close bars, restaurants and hotels for months among a raft of containment measures.

As occasions for revelry dried up, exports to China, a key growth market, also plunged, down 15.2 percent to 809 million euros. Exports to Britain -- the second-biggest export market after the US -- were down 6.5 percent to 1.3 billion euros.
