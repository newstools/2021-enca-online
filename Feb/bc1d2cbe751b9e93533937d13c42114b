President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to face some tough questions from opposition parties in Parliament. The National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces will hold joint sittings on Tuesday and Wednesday to debate the State of the Nation Address. PARLIAMENT - Pressure is mounting on President Cyril Ramaphosa to act against his predecessor, Jacob Zuma. Freedom Front Plus leader Pieter Groenewald said Zuma belongs in jail for defying the Constitutional Court and not appearing at the state capture inquiry. Groenewald said: "Honourable President when you were asked about the fact that former president Zuma refused to appear before the Zondo commission, you said: let's give Zuma space, time to think.

The only time he needs is a couple of years determined by a judge. And, I can assure you, there'll be ample time to think," Groenewald said. "I'm going to ask you a very serious question this afternoon: Are you considering presidential pardon for Zuma? "You [are] on record saying you'd rather be seen as a weak president, but you'd do everything to save the ANC. Zuma is busy politically putting pressure on the ANC, and he knows that you can give him a presidential pardon."
