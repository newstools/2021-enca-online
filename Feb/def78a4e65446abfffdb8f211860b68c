AFP/Pool DUESSELDORF - Britain's 200m world champion Dina Asher-Smith picked up her second indoor victory over 60m in Germany this week by winning the women's final in Duesseldorf on Sunday. Having equalled her personal best by running 7.08 seconds to claim victory in Karlsruhe on Friday, the 25-year-old clocked 7.12 to win the women's 60m final on Sunday. This week was the first time the British sprint queen has raced indoors for three years and anywhere for well over a year. "I am happy to be back running again. It has been quite a long time since my last race in 2019," Asher-Smith told Athletics Weekly. "I was very surprised how well I started in Karlsruhe," she added having narrowly missed the British 60m indoor record on Friday. "I was very happy to come out and run a 7.08 and I was happy to do some good performances here (in Duesseldorf) as well." Asher-Smith dominated at the Duesseldorf meet, held behind closed doors because of the coronavirus pandemic, as she prepares for the Tokyo Olympics. She finished ahead of Swiss sprinter Ajla del Ponte, who ran a personal best of 7.16secs.
