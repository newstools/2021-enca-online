Courtesy of #DStv403 FREE STATE - Free State police have opened a case under the Disaster Management Act for an illegal gathering at Hertzog Plein. Hundreds of supporters gathered in contravention of lockdown regulations to show their support for ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule. Scores of supporters failed to wear masks and practice social distancing. READ: NPA 'confident' in strength of Magashule case Brigadier Sam Makhele said: “The police decided because the law allows people to be warned to put their masks on, those who had masks they did put them on. But later some violated the rules and proceeded to Hertzog Plein and it was then when we decided, let us rather register a case because this is an illegal gathering". WATCH: Magashule back in court "I think people need to understand that police are trained and know when to act and when not to act. But when people don’t want to take responsibility and put themselves in a dangerous situation, the police are there to make sure that they manage the situation in a manner where you don’t get a chaotic situation, and that’s the steps we took during the day.” Magashule faces charges of fraud and corruption in relation to the Free State asbestos project. He appeared in the Bloemfontein Magistrate's Court on Friday.
