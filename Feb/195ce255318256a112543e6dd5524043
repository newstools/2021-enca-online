File: Caster Semenya. JOHANNESBURG - South Africa's athletics queen, Caster Semenya, has officially filed a lawsuit in the European Human Rights Court. The two-time Olympic champion is challenging restrictions on testosterone levels in female athletes. The World Athletics governing body in 2018 banned Semenya and other female athletes with differences in sexual development. Semenya is barred from races between 400 metres and a mile unless she reduces her testosterone levels by using hormone-suppressing drugs.

On 19 February, she made a fresh attempt to challenge the ruling - taking the matter to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. Her lawyers, Norton Rose Fulbright, say Semenya's ongoing fight for dignity, equality, and the human rights of women in sport took a crucial step forward with the filing of this application.
