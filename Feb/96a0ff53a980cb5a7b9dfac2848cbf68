AFP/Alastair Grant CHENNAI - Skipper Joe Root on Saturday became the first batsman to score a double century in his 100th Test in England's opening match against India. Root hit a six to pass 200 for the fifth time in his England career, extending a golden run that followed match-winning scores of 228 and 186 against Sri Lanka in Tests last month. Root, who made his England debut in India in 2012, has scored three of the double tons as captain.

Root has been the lynchpin of the innings as England passed 440-4 in their first innings.
