Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Steep fuel prices are expected next week and it gets worse in April when levies were announced in this week’s budget kicks in. The Automobile Association of South Africa says a stronger rand/dollar exchange hasn't offset the effects of a higher oil price. It estimates that fuel users can expect to see petrol up by around R0,66 a litre in March.

Diesel will rise by as much as 57 cents and paraffin by R0.49. Levies to the value of 27 cents will take the fuel price even higher from April.
