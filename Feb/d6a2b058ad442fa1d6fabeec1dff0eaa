The 18-year-old from Soweto is blazing a trail in the world of two wheels. At 18, Nkomo is already justifying the faith shown in her since she started cycling at 13. Age-group titles under her belt include the Gauteng Provincial Champs and the Amashova Durban Classic. The 2020 matriculant has also ticked two Cape Town Cycle Tours off her bucket list. As one of the few black women in cycling, Nkomo knows the importance of making the sport more accessible. * eNCA's Hloni Mtimkulu has more details in the video above.
