The ban applies to ships carrying more than 100 people. eNCA/Estelle Bronkhorst OTTAWA - Canada said it was extending a ban on cruise ships entering its waters through February 2022 because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The ban applies to ships carrying more than 100 people, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said in a statement. "Temporary prohibitions to cruise vessels and pleasure craft are essential to continue to protect the most vulnerable among our communities and avoid overwhelming our health care systems," he said. If pandemic conditions "sufficiently improve" during the period, he added, the government could move to rescind the order.

The measure has dealt a severe blow to Canadian port cities such as Vancouver, Quebec and Montreal, where the cruise industry is a vital moneymaker. In 2019, Canada was visited by cruise ships from a dozen countries with some two million tourists on board, according to the ministry. Croisieres du Saint-Laurent, an association representing nine ports of call along the busy seaway, said the cancellation of cruises for a second year will have "serious impacts on the tourism industry."

Adventure-seeking sailboats and other pleasure craft as well as passenger ships carrying more than 12 people are also still banned from Canadian Arctic waters, the ministry said. Local residents of Canada's Arctic territories using boats for transport or fishing, however, are exempted. The Northwest Territories, Yukon and Nunavut have so far managed to keep their total number of COVID-19 cases to just 400, but they lack sufficient health resources to cope in the event of a major outbreak.
