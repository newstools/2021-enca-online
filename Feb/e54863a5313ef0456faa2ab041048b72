Scopa briefs parliament on PPE investigations. JOHANNESBURG - Special Investigating Unit (SIU) members were threatened while investigating PPE corruption. SIU Head Advocate Andy Mothibi revealed this in Parliament on Wednesday. He was briefing Scopa on the unit's progress in its crackdown.

The unit's head, Andy Mothibi said this was largely due to their involvement in irregularities.

"This was largely because of their involvement in the irregular procurement process. Of course in this regard, where there is non-cooperation voluntarily, then we would invoke the SIU powers in terms of the legislation that enables us to investigate and we would then proceed with the investigation," Mothibi said. "As I indicated there, we had to improvise and the opportunity for online interaction and physical interaction."
