Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - More than 10,000 pupils in the Western Cape still need to find a school. The provincial education department says it’s working on getting these children placed as soon as possible. Provincial Education MEC Debbie Schäfer said: “We are always looking to see what we can do. READ: Schools ready to open on Monday "We sometimes need to try and get extra mobiles, but even with a third of our infrastructure budget last year having to be diverted to COVID measures, it’s extremely difficult.” Schäfer adds there were 59 schools vandalised over the December holidays, but this did not deter any of them from opening on Monday. * eNCA's Monique Mortlock reports.
