An empty pub. AFP/Karim Sahib DUBAI - Dubai ordered bars and pubs to close until the end of the month to suppress a spike in coronavirus cases after tourists flocked to the emirate over the holiday period. The closures, effective from Tuesday, are among a raft of steps "taken in response to rising violations of preventive measures," authorities said in a statement. Indoor venues, including cinemas and sports venues, will have their capacity cut by half.
