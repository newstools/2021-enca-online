President Cyril Ramaphosa. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has assured South Africans that the net is "closing in" on those involved in fraud and corruption. Ramaphosa wrote this in his weekly communique, 'From the desk of the president'. His remarks follow the Special Investigating Unit's report on PPE tender corruption, which was released last week. READ: PPE corruption: Ramaphosa says funds will be recovered The SIU has instituted civil matters to the value of R259-million for review by the Special Tribunal. These include the recovery of state funds associated with the Covid-19 state of disaster. The President says all those involved in wrongdoing will be dealt with harshly. The report released last week by the SIU into procurement during the state of disaster makes for disturbing reading. At the same time, it provides encouragement that unlawful deeds are being uncovered and action is being taken against those responsible. https://t.co/VtNHYGq84y pic.twitter.com/QmZFmCvw7n
