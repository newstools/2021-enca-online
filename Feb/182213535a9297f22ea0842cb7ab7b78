Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo said the state capture inquiry will apply to the Constitutional Court for an order of contempt of court against Jacob Zuma. The commission also says it will apply for a prison term to be imposed on Zuma, instead of a fine, if he is found to be in contempt. WATCH: State capture inquiry responds to Zuma's absence Zondo slammed Zuma's action of defying the court order to appear before the commission. "The commission has taken note that in this type of situation the law makes provision that it may institute contempt court proceeding, the commission will do so," Zondo said. "That entails the commission making an application to the ConCourt, which is the court that made the order for Zuma and seeks an order that Zuma is guilty of contempt of court. If the ConCourt reaches that conclusion, it's in its discretion to decide what to do. READ: State Capture Inquiry: Zuma no-show confirmed "One could be [a] term of imprisonment or impose a fine. The commission will approach the ConCourt and ask it to impose the term of imprisonment if its finds that he is guilty. It will be up to the court what it considers appropriate." Earlier on Monday, Zondo also said the testimonies before him on Zuma are no longer allegations but evidence.
