The Bank of England cut its UK growth forecasts with governor Mark Carney warning that high inflation triggered by a Brexit-fuelled slump in the pound had hurt consumer spending. LONDON - Britain's economy shrank by a record 9.9 percent last year on the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic despite managing strong growth in the second half, official data showed on Friday. Finance minister Rishi Sunak said the economy had suffered a "serious shock" from the COVID-19 global health crisis. The data came one week after the Bank of England forecast  economic recovery on the back of Britain's successful ongoing vaccines rollout. "Over the year 2020 as a whole, GDP contracted by 9.9 percent, marking the largest annual fall in UK GDP on record," the Office for National Statistics said in a statement.

The data has sparked hope that Britain could avoid a much-feared double-dip recession, despite the new strict lockdown that has been in place since January. "Today's figures show that the economy has experienced a serious shock as a result of the pandemic, which has been felt by countries around the world," Chancellor of the Exchequer Sunak said in reaction to the data. "While there are some positive signs of the economy's resilience over the winter, we know that the current lockdown continues to have a significant impact on many people and businesses. "That's why my focus remains fixed on doing everything we can to protect jobs, businesses and livelihoods," he said, adding he would set out further support measures in his upcoming budget on March 3.
