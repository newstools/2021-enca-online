Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - The City of Johannesburg says it has a plan to deal with criminals who target students. Wits students, in particular, have become prime fodder while crossing Nelson Mandela Bridge. They’re not the only ones. READ: Ramaphosa: Crime remains a priority A study done in 2019 by fourth-year UJ social work students has also laid bare the crimes experienced on and off-campus, including how students have been robbed of cellphones and laptops, while others have been hijacked. But, authorities say change is underfoot. The Johannesburg mayor, the JMPD and the city’s Public Safety Department are declaring war on the crimes that occur on the bridge. READ: Over 900 arrested in Gauteng for various crimes "We are deploying metro police officers on the bridge," mayor Geoff Makhubo said. "We've been working together with Wits security and other security companies in Braamfontein." The mayor believes the crimes against students are stopping them from breaking the cycle of poverty. * eNCA's Nqobile Madlala reports.
