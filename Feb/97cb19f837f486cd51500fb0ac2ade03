Pakistan won the first Test by seven wickets in Karachi. Pakistan's only previous series win over South Africa was in a two-match series at home in 2003. The series against South Africa - who were touring Pakistan for the first time in 14 years - is the biggest hosted by the home side since a deadly 2009 militant attack on Sri Lanka's squad in Lahore halted international tours. The two teams will now play three Twenty20 internationals on February 11, 13 and 14, all in Lahore.
