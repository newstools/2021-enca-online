Every year, Trenery runs a print competition that’ll finally be turned into garments and sold in stores. This year, a young Pretoria designer’s dream came true after winning the top prize. Glorinah Khutso Mabaso couldn’t believe her luck when she got the call that she won the Trenery Print Competition. It was open exclusively to emerging local designers who were up to the task to create unique modern South African prints. Mabaso’s bold and colourful print titled The Rain Maker has been turned into a striking collection that will feature in the brand’s February collection both locally and internationally, giving the designer a massive boost into the industry. * eNCA's Tanya Nefdt reports.
