Paul Grisham (91) did not even remember losing the billfold when friendly strangers contacted him to return it via mail, The San Diego Union-Tribune reported this week. The lucky discovery was made during the 2014 demolition of the scientific base on Ross Island, where Grisham had been stationed as a weather forecaster from October 1967 to November 1968. The sailor's wallet was hidden behind a locker and contained, among other things: his Navy identity card, his driver's license, a reference card for what to do in case of a biological or chemical weapons attack... and a ration card for beer. Grisham said he was "blown away" that so many people had gone to great lengths to reunite the wallet with its owner. It took a long line of Good Samaritans to return the wallet to him. The head of a research group in Antarctica contacted one of his former employees, who previously had successfully reunited a Navy ID bracelet -- spotted for sale in a store -- with its rightful owner. Along with his daughter, they appealed to a foundation for veterans, who in turn contacted the Naval Weather Service Association, of which Grisham had been a member. The wallet finally arrived last Saturday in good condition at Grisham's home in San Carlos, northern California.
