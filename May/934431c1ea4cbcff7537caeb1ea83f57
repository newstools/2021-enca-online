Authorities started distributing tents, mattresses, and covers to those in need in the Gaza Strip, an AFP reporter said, a day after a ceasefire ended deadly Israeli airstrikes on the besieged coastal enclave and rocket fire out of it towards Israel. Attention turned to rebuilding the territory controlled by the Islamic group Hamas, with the United Nations saying Saturday that at least 6,000 people had been made homeless. Rescue workers searched for bodies or survivors in mounds of rubble, as residents tried to assess what was left of their previous lives. The latest round of bombardment killed 248 people in Gaza, including 66 children, and wounded more than 1,900 since May 10, the health ministry says.

Israel claims it has killed "more than 200 terrorists", including 25 commanders. Rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups killed 12 people in Israel including a child, an Israeli soldier, an Indian citizen, and two Thai nationals, the police say, and injured around 357 people. - 9,000 homeless - A truck loaded with humanitarian aid passes through the Kerem Shalom crossing into Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip In front of a flattened tower block where she used to rent out apartments, Aisha Mousallem was wearing black. "Even if I lost no one in my family, I'm in mourning," she said.

"The building effort is going to be really quite profound," she told AFP. Earlier on Saturday, shopkeepers assessed the damage, finding many supplies coated in thick layers of dust. Shopkeeper Wael Amin al-Sharafa said he had stocked up his shop with new clothes to sell during the usually busy season of Eid al-Fitr at the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan. Palestinian fishermen set out to sea from Gaza City after a ban on fishing was lifted "But now it's all lost," he said. "Who will pay for all this? I have no idea." Rami Abu Amira and a dozen other fishermen prepared their nets before heading out to sea for the first time in two weeks. "We need to eat," he said after the Gaza coastguard allowed fishing again. Abu Amira said, however, he would stick close to the coastline, adding: "We, fishermen are scared the Israeli navy will shoot at us. It's up to everyone to decide whether to go or not."  - 'Two-state solution' -  Convoys of lorries carrying aid began passing into Gaza Friday through the Kerem Shalom crossing after it was reopened by Israel, bringing much-needed medicine, food and fuel.

The incident was reminiscent of the tensions in Jerusalem that sparked the latest round of conflict. Israeli security forces had cracked down on protests against the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes to make way for Jewish settlers in the annexed east Jerusalem neighbourhood of Sheikh Jarrah. And they had also moved in on worshippers at Al-Aqsa, Islam's third holiest site, which is also revered by Jews as Temple Mount. Hamas on May 10 launched rockets from Gaza towards Israel, in "solidarity" with Palestinians in Jerusalem. The conflict sparked mob violence in Israel, and clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian protesters in the West Bank. Gaza City buildings destroyed in Israeli air raids
