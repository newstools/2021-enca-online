The President made the announcement on Sunday after discussions with cabinet. Under the Level 2 restrictions: "While the country is headed towards a third wave of infections, we do not yet know how severe this wave will be or for how long it will last," the President said. READ: South Africa moves to lockdown alert level two "According to the scientists that advise government, the severity of this third wave will largely be determined by the amount of contact each of us has with other people," he says. The President urges people to strictly observe all health protocols by wearing masks, keeping social distancing from others and ensuring proper ventilation. Where possible, cut down on all contact. Vaccination Two weeks ago, South Africa started phase two of its vaccination programme, targeting the balance of our health workers who had not yet been vaccinated during the first phase and all those in the country who are over 60 years of age. More than 67 per cent of public health workers have been vaccinated. Over 3 million people registered on the Electronic Vaccine Data System. There are four ways that you can register to receive your COVID-19 vaccine: We must remember that the virus does not move from place to place by itself; it relies on the movement of people. The less we travel, the less the virus is spread. It is especially important to avoid indoor spaces, as the coronavirus is spread through the air when a person speaks, coughs or sneezes.
If you need to meet someone, including a member of your family, it is safer to do so outside in a well-ventilated space. We will reduce the pressure on our hospitals, and, in doing so, we will save many lives. As we continue to focus on reducing transmission of the virus through our behaviour, we have embarked on the biggest mass vaccination programme in our country’s history.
