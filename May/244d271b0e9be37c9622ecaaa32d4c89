Gigaba testified before the State Capture Inquiry on Monday. "Now the affidavit as I have sought to highlight on a number of occasions contains some very serious contradictions that indicate that this is not the affidavit that she wrote or it is based on media narratives which have existed all along, to which I have not responded, I have sought to remain silent believing that the opportunity would come for me to sit before the chairperson and to answer to the many allegations," he said. READ: Gigaba unsure how many times he met Guptas He also says the issue of the Guptas' naturalisation was quite extensive. Their applications were denied and they appealed. Gigaba has also denied ever receiving money from the Guptas. In her last appearance before the commission, Mngoma said her husband was a frequent visitor to the Guptas and was under pressure to do their bidding.
