Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - A Pretoria school principal has been left traumatised after parents physically threw her out of her office. In a video circulated on social media, the principal of Theresapark Primary is carried out of the building by angry parents while still sitting in her chair. "I still feel pain, traumatised and humiliated," said Dorothy Mabaso. Mabaso has denied accusations that she has been bullying staff at school. Gauteng Education MEC Panyaza Lesufi has visited the school and condemned the incident. He also visited Mabaso. "I don't expect an employee of the department to be touched, intimidate, attacked like this," said Lesufi. "It hurt me." Lesufi said resolving the issue is important for the pupils at the school. * eNCA's Lindokuhle Xulu reports.
