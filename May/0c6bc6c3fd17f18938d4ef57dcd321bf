AFP/Thomas Coex JOHANNESBURG - Western Cape Health MEC, Nomafrench Mbombo says the province is ready for the second phase of the vaccine rollout, this time targeting senior citizens. Mbombo says the rollout will be done in phases to avoid a system collapse. The Western Cape is set to vaccinate over 700 000 senior citizens starting on Monday when the second phase of the vaccination rollout kicks off. "We are ready. We have 70 sites in the metro and about 204 in the rural areas," she said.

So on Monday, seven of the sites in metro will be active." Meanwhile, Mbombo says just under a third of the province's senior citizens have registered to get vaccinated. The provincial Health Department is encouraging more senior citizens to register for the COVID-19 vaccine.
