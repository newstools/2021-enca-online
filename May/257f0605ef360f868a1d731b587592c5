Courtesy #DStv403 DURBAN - Amid fears that South Africa is heading towards a third wave of COVID-19, there are serious concerns as a government-owned crematorium in Durban is once again not operating. Mobeni Heights Crematorium has been shut for the second time this year after running out of gas. And the poor are paying the price. READ: Crematorium out of service for a year Cremation at the facility costs about R800, but families now have to pay at least R2,500 to use private facilities. Last year, the Public Protector ordered the City of eThekwini to install a new R3.5-million furnace. It did so, but the problems at Mobeni Heights persist. * eNCA’s Mawande Kheswa reports.
