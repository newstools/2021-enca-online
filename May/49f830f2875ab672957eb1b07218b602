Cabinet has reiterated this after Gauteng Transport MEC, Jacob Mamabolo said the tolls are a thing of the past. "The question around e-tolls, the minister of transport continues to table various reports around e-tolls and continues to engage on what are the possibilities for e-tolls," said Acting Minister in the Presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshaveni. "What I can assure South Africans is that the cabinet is considering the possibility of what should happen should e-tolls be scrapped or what should happen if e-tolls should be maintained."
