File: load-shedding. JOHANNESBURG - Eskom will implement Stage 1 load-shedding between 5pm and 10pm on Wednesday. The power utility says is due to a shortage of generation capacity resulting from breakdowns and delays in returning generator units to service. READ: Load-shedding was always going to be a problem - former Eskom CEO Eskom says it will be working speedily to return more generators to service.
The utility warns that more load-shedding might be implemented later in the week if the generators don't work as expected. Eskom is urging South Africans to use electricity sparingly.
