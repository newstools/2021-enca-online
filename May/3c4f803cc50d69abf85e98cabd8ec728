Miners busy with operations during their shift. AFP/Mujahid Safodien JOHANNESBURG - One part of the local economy is surging at the moment. The mining sector has seen sales jump almost 47-percent year-on-year in March to R75-billion. Statistics SA says the numbers were boosted by record commodity prices and expectations that the world economy will grow faster than expected. Platinum-group metal sales contributed most to the windfall, surging 76 percent. Mining employs more than 450,000 people in South Africa and contributes about 8 percent to GDP. The increased sales have helped strengthen the rand.
