If I needed to discuss issues with the board of SAA, I either convened the chairperson and the CEO of the board and discussed issues with them or request special general meetings with the board in order to raise certain issues or the department would engage either the board or the executive management of SAA to discuss matters relating to the airline," he said. "Any other thing that seeks to suggest that there was information that Ms. Myeni fed to the former president is a fabrication." Gigaba appeared before the commission Monday.
