Mkhize said he hopes that the J&J vaccines will be released this week. He says a global audit is being done and he will meet with the company on Wednesday.

"We are expecting that the J&J vaccine, those vaccines should be released we are hoping sometime this week," he said. "I am going to be having a meeting with J&J global office by Wednesday so we will know after Wednesday exactly when they will release them. "The vaccines are ready, they are manufactured we know they are not contaminated we know they are safe and available. We're just waiting for the global audit process to be completed."
