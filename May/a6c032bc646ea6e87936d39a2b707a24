The Special Investigating Unit is cracking the whip on the power utility. It's been given the green light to freeze R11-million held in a bank account linked to a senior Eskom manager. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Special Investigating Unit has been granted an interim order to freeze a bank account belonging to a senior Eskom manager. The probe started after a tip-off that manager Petrus Mazibuko was receiving kickbacks from two Eskom suppliers. This was allegedly through a bank account held by Thephunokhetja Projects. The SIU obtained bank statements and other documents relating to the account. The SIU says it's found no evidence that the company provided services or was legally entitled to claim for goods or services rendered. The unit has referred its evidence to Eskom and recommends he be suspended pending the completion of the investigation.
