Courtesy of #DStv403 LIMPOPO - A dream come true, is how President Cyril Ramaphosa described on Saturday as he handed over title deeds to black farmers in Tafelkop in Limpopo. This is part of the government's Land Redistribution Programme. READ: 2.7 million hectares transferred to land claimants Ramaphosa also says farmers need support, and that the government will give it to them.
"This for me confirms the approach and the policy that we have taken to give <the> land back to our people, put people can work the land. This notion that they must be regarded as emerging farmers is a fable." "They are working farmers, they have been producing their exporting and all they need is support and we are going to support them. Because for me, this is confirmation black people need the land which has always belonged to them that was taken away and we must support them in every way possible."
