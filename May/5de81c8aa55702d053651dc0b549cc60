AFP/Amy Sussman/Getty Images LONDON - British supermodel Naomi Campbell has become the mother of a baby girl at the age of 50, she said in a surprise announcement on Instagram. "A beautiful little blessing has chosen me to be her mother," she wrote with a photograph of her hand cradling a tiny pair of infant feet. "So honoured to have this gentle soul in my life," she continued, adding that there were "no words to describe the lifelong bond that I now share with you my angel. There is no greater love." A post shared by Naomi Campbell (@naomi) Campbell did not give more details. She had spoken previously about becoming a mother, telling the Evening Standard magazine in 2017 that "I think about having children all the time." But, she added, "with the way science is I think I can do it when I want." The jet-setting, barrier-breaking model still poses for magazine covers, in between charity and NGO work -- particularly in Africa -- and reality TV appearances. In 2019, when asked about children by WSJ magazine, she replied: "Not yet -- I'll see what the universe brings me."
