The Modjadji Royal Council says it is because she was taken from the family at just five months old. Her brother was then prepared for the throne. Another bone of contention was the princess's father claiming her, which is taboo in the culture. The Balobedu nation has been in existence for over 400 years and is famous for the ability to control clouds and rainfall.

A week ago, the Modjadji Royal Council announced that her older brother, Prince Lekukela, as heir. While this would mark the end of Africa's only female monarchy, the Modjadji Royal Council says the reign of kings is nothing new to their culture as the first 6 Balobedu monarchs were kings. The princess's father claiming his daughter is also looked down upon in the culture. Princess Masalanabo’s father, former Tzaneen Municipal Manager David Mogale, died in 2014 after a protracted battle with the Modjadji royal family over her custody.
