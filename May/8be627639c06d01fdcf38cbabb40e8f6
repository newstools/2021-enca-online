AFP/Michele Spatari JOHANNESBURG - Precious metals miner Sibanye-Stillwater says the start of this year has been positive, despite COVID-19 disruptions. In a record quarter ending in March, the miner says it generated more earnings from its SA platinum group metal mines than it paid for the assets. This has been through an aggressive race to become the world's top supplier of those metals. Sibanye-Stillwater reports a record increase in its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of 78-percent year-on-year to R19.8-billion. The company says it expects the outlook for 2021 and beyond to be even more positive. Its market cap is now R195-billion compared to the R10-billion when it listed in 2013.
