Isaac Dintwe has provided details about political interference from - among others - Bongo, and the director-general of the State Security Agency, Arthur Fraser. And how Bongo and Fraser's actions were brazen and unconstitutional. In response, Bongo has called for the State Capture Inquiry chair, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, to call on him to testify. READ: Bongani Bongo's corruption case postponed According to Bongo, the only time he met Dintwe was when there was a complaint against him by Fraser. Dintwe had allegedly collided with a state vehicle four times under the influence of alcohol. "So, I was dealing with that case," he says. Bongo alleges that Dintwe does not know how to conduct oversight. He says that under the mandate given to him by former president Jacob Zuma, he was supposed to stabilise the State Security Agency and he believes he did just that.
