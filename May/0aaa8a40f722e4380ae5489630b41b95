EXPLAINER: Key facts about the European Super League Fans from outside Poland will be allowed in, with UEFA saying each finalist will be allocated 2,000 tickets while 2,000 more will go on sale to the general public. The remaining tickets will be distributed to other groups such as commercial partners of UEFA, broadcasters and national associations. "Supporters from abroad will have to comply with border entry restrictions and requirements that will be in force at the time of the final as no exemptions will be granted to ticket holders," UEFA said in a statement. It added that supporters may need to provide proof of a vaccine or a negative Covid-19 test in order to enter the ground. The Gdansk venue on Poland's Baltic coast, which hosted matches at Euro 2012, was due to stage the Europa League final last year before the pandemic intervened. Instead last season's competition concluded with a 'Final 8' format in Germany, with Sevilla beating Inter Milan in the final in Cologne.
