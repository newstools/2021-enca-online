But the Health Department says the system will automatically reschedule a new date if they fail to attend their appointment. READ: COVID-19 Vaccine: Senior citizens urged to register "There are two re-appointments plus the initial appointment, which are generated automatically in the system but there will be people who are abroad, at work or are ill or in hospital, who are unable to attend any of those three appointments, the system does not delete their records, we know that they are registered and the system will park that record until they either make contact with us or on a scheduled basis, we will try and make an appointment with those people," said Nicholas Crisp from the health department. The department is urging youngsters to assist senior citizens with the online registration process.
