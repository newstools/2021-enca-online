Serbia's top-ranked Novak Djokovic. AFP/Paul Crock SERBIA - World number one Novak Djokovic booked his place in the semi-finals in Belgrade with a 6-1, 6-0 win over Federico Coria on Thursday that puts him fifth on the list of Open era wins. The 56-minute demolition of the 96th ranked Argentinian took Djokovic to 952 wins, putting him one win ahead of Guillermo Vilas. "It was a great performance," said Djokovic, who is tuning up for the French Open which begins in Paris on Sunday. "And probably one of the best matches, if not the best match, I played this year. I felt fantastic on the court from the first point."
