READ: Masuku, Diko appeals upheld This follows an appeal to the ANC’s national disciplinary committee by both Masuku and suspended Presidential Spokesperson Khusela Diko. The SIU says it submitted evidence and successfully argued before the full bench of the High Court, that Masuku failed to exercise his responsibility in the oversight of the Gauteng Department of Health. The body is now calling on the former MEC to lodge an appeal, rather than issue statements which they say, are misleading to the public.
