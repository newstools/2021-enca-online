A coronial inquest heard that Sydney man Bruce Roberts shot intruder Shane Snellman during an attempted home robbery in 2002 and kept the body in his house, public broadcaster ABC reported.

The body was surrounded by more than 70 bottles of air freshener used to mask the smell, the coroner's court reportedly heard. Roberts was said to be an extreme hoarder who rarely left his home, where more than a dozen firearms were also found.
