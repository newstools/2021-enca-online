Iceland eruption sprays lava into the night sky. AFP/Jeremie Richard REYKJAVIK - Iceland's Fagradalshraun volcano lies quiet for a spell before suddenly spewing red molten lava geysers high into the air, visible from the capital Reykjavik in an awe-inspiring display. The volcano, which sprang into life in mid-March in the Geldingadalir valley near Mount Fagradalsfjall, has drawn visitors from around the world, many venturing as close as possible to the safety perimeter set up to protect against sprays of red-hot rock.

One geyser was measured at more than 460 metres at dawn last Wednesday, according to the national meteorological office. The powerful bursts throw up rock fragments called tephra, some still hot, that land several hundred metres from the crater, which is located in an uninhabited area on the Reykjanes peninsula in southwestern Iceland.

"All the time the magma is flowing," Gudmundsson told AFP. "This is not uncommon and this is a normal behaviour. It is, if anything, less common to have a very continuous flow with no pulsations." The eruption, which began on March 19, is the first on the Reykjanes peninsula in more than eight centuries, and it has been nearly 6,000 years since the last activity at the precise site.
