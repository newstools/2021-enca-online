Antonio Conte joined Inter Milan in May 2019 MILAN - Antonio Conte's future with Inter Milan is in doubt despite leading the club to the Serie A title for the first time in over a decade, according to reports in Italy on Wednesday. "Inter-Conte, divorce!," headlined the daily Gazzetta Dello Sport, reporting that the "final farewell could arrive in the next 48 hours". "Conte ready to break away," headlined Corriere Dello Sport.

Inter-registered losses of 100 million euros last season mainly due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Suning Group shut down their Chinese club Jiangsu FC in February months after it won the Chinese Super League title. Five days ago, Inter secured a cash injection worth 275 million euros ($336 million) with US investment firm Oaktree, in the form of a loan reported to be over three years.

The former Chelsea and Juventus boss took over in May 2019 on a three-year contract worth a reported 12 million euros ($14 million) a season. His departure had also been heralded last summer after the club's Europa League final defeat to Sevilla and finishing runners-up in the league to Juventus. Conte had blamed the club's lack of investment on their failure to challenge in the Champions League in which they crashed out in the group stage in each of the last three seasons.
