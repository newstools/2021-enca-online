eNCA Logo On 4 May we published an article entitled “Vessel from India docked in Durban, crew tests positive for COVID-19” which was accompanied by an image of an MSC cruise liner. The image was not associated with the article and we confirm that MSC Cruises currently do not have any cruise liners in South Africa. We apologise to MSC Cruises and our readers for the error and any confusion it may have caused.
