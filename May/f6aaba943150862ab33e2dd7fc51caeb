AFP/Pascal Pavani PARIS - Airbus said it will produce more single-aisle planes in 2023 than before the coronavirus crisis as the European aerospace giant sees the aviation sector ascending from the pandemic. The aircraft maker had slowed its production early on in the pandemic last year as COVID-19 and border closures caused a massive drop in air traffic, severely denting the earnings of airlines. But Airbus said that it expects the commercial aircraft market "to recover to pre-Covid levels between 2023 and 2025, led by the single-aisle segment".

Airbus shares soared at the Paris stock exchange following the announcement. Airbus is currently producing 40 planes of the A320 family per month but the company said it would increase the average rate to 45 during the last three months of this year.

The cadence will increase to 70 per month in 2024 and possibly 75 by 2025. The company was producing 60 planes per month before the pandemic and had planned to increase the rate to 63 in 2020 until Covid-19 changed those plans. The aerospace firm also cut 15,000 jobs out of 135,000 posts, though the company avoided layoffs in France, Germany, Britain and Spain, its main locations.
