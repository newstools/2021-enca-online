South Africa's Lloyd Harris returns a forehand to Chile's Christian Garin during their first round match of the Men's Italian Open at Foro Italico in Rome, Italy. AFP/Filippo Monteforte ROME - Lloyd Harris has once again failed to impress, this time in Rome. That after crashing out in the last 32 of the Madrid Open last week. Harris has now lost his first-round Italian Open clash to Cristian Garin in straight sets. The 22nd-ranked Chilean never looked under threat and sealed the match in an hour and 38 minutes. Harris entered the tournament ranked 50th in the world and struggled against the clay-court specialist, converting only one of his four break attempts.
