Well, such delights are on offer this Wednesday at the Osenat auction house in Fontainebleau near Paris to mark the 200th anniversary of the death of Napoleon Bonaparte. "These precious objects were given to my father by the General de Montholon on his return from St Helena," reads a sworn statement accompanying the objects, signed by the "second duke of Bassono". A cotton strip stained with Napoleon's blood that was used in his autopsy Napoleon was exiled to St Helena in 1815 after his defeat by the British at the Battle of Waterloo. He died there six years later. The objects include "a small white silk bag enclosing the hair of HM Emperor Napoleon I" as well as his personalised handkerchief and a cloth used in his autopsy. Montholon was one of the last companions of the former emperor on the island, and assisted at Napoleon's autopsy on May 6, 1821, a day after his death.
