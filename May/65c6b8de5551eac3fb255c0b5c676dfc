AFP/Steve Marcus/Getty Images LAS VEGAS - Philippine boxing icon Manny Pacquiao said on Friday he'll fight unbeaten unified welterweight world champion Errol Spence in Las Vegas in August. The 42-year-old legend will be fighting for the first time since he beat Keith Thurman in July 2019 for the WBA welterweight title. He revealed his plans with a Twitter post of a promotional poster for the bout captioned "Pacquiao v Spence, August 21, 2021, Las Vegas, Nevada". The Athletic, citing an unnamed source, reported that Pacquiao had signed a deal for a bout to be available on Fox pay per view, and the venue was expected to be the MGM Grand.

Pacquiao, a serving senator in the Philippines, told the US sports outlet that the fight "might be" his last. If so, he appears to want to go out with a bang. "I love to challenge the top guy," the eight-division champion told The Athletic. Spence, the 31-year-old WBC and IBF champion, is 27-0 and coming off a dominant December victory over Danny Garcia -- his first fight since surviving a near-fatal rollover car accident.
