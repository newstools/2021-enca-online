'In This Case' by Jean-Michel Basquiat sold for $93.1 million NEW YORK - Jean-Michel Basquiat's painting "In this Case" sold for $93.1-million in an auction at Christie's in New York, the second-highest price paid for a work by the late artist. The 1983 painting, which depicts a skull on a red background, sold for $81-million, but with fees and commissions, the final price came to $93.1-million, well above the estimate of $50-million. It was another skull, "Untitled", that set the record for the most expensive by Basquiat (1960-1988), which went for $110.5 million in May 2017 at Sotheby's in New York. "In This Case" reprises two dominant themes in Basquiat's work, anatomy and representation of African-American characters.

With the exception of New York-based Basquiat, African American painters have long been undervalued by collectors and underrepresented in museums. In recent years, the market has started a process of re-evaluating many of them. On Tuesday, Christie's had presented several Black artists as part of its big spring sale. A Nina Chanel Abney work sold for $990,000, a Jordan Casteel went for $687,500 and a Rashid Johnson fetched $1.95-million. A work by British artist Lynette Yiadom-Boakye was sold for $1.95-million and a piece by Ghanaian sculptor El Anatsui went under the hammer for $1.95-million, all of them setting new records.
