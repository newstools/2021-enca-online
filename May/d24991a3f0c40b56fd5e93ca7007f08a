A state of emergency in key parts of Japan including Tokyo caused the country's economy to shrink more than expected in the first quarter. AFP/Charly Triballeau NEW YORK - Wall Street followed Europe and Asia higher at the open Tuesday, as investors shook off concerns over inflation and rising coronavirus infections in some countries and weak GDP readings in the eurozone and Japan. The Dow Jones Industrial Average inched up in initial trades, outpaced by the Nasdaq whose many tech companies had been burdened by inflation fears. "Markets appear to be focusing at the moment on 2021 economic prosperity as vaccines continue to ramp up in the US and Europe," Charles Schwab analysts wrote. That optimism stood up to a 1.3 percent first-quarter contraction in Japanese GDP and a 0.6 percent fall in the 19-nation eurozone, revealed in official data releases. Lower output didn't hold Tokyo's stock market back from leading Asian gains, while Taiwan and Singapore defied fears of spreading coronavirus variants to close higher. Meanwhile Frankfurt hit a new record before falling back in afternoon deals. The eurozone's January-March growth reading was "old news", Capital Economics analyst Jack Allen-Reynolds commented, saying that "more recently the economy is likely to have begun to recover" as countries ease restrictions. Oil fell back after Brent crude briefly broke $70 a barrel, hitting the highest level since March on solid demand as economies reopen around the world. And the dollar slid versus its main rivals as easing inflation worries dampened the prospect of a US interest-rate rise, while the pound won support from upbeat UK unemployment numbers.
