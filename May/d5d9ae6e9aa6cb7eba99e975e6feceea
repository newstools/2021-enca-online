File: A card with a heart. Pixabay/Kaboompics WASHINGTON - Vaxxing, not waxing, is the new must-do before a hot date, with dating apps joining the White House on Friday to promote Covid-19 shots. Tinder, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, BLK, Chispa, Plenty of Fish, Bumble, and Badoo are all adding vaccination status to the more expected details on dating profiles as part of a rollout over the next few weeks. Getting the shot may also do more for lovers than keep them healthy, the White House said in a statement. "According to research from OKCupid, people who are vaccinated or plan to get vaccinated receive 14 percent more Matches than people who don't plan to get vaccinated," it revealed.

"It is kind of a funny thing to talk about, but the truth of the matter is people do want to get back to their normal lives," Andy Slavitt, a senior White House Covid advisor, told reporters. In a statement, OkCupid said the phrase "I'm vaccinated" increased over 1,400 percent in May compared to January. More than seven in 10 daters on the app say they will get the COVID-19 vaccine, and only seven percent of singles now say they're not comfortable with in-person dating.

"We're excited to work with the White House to help 70 percent of American adults get vaccinated by July 4th," said the company's CEO Jim Lanzone. "Nothing like fireworks to signal a new spark and a new start for those looking to meet new people IRL this summer."
