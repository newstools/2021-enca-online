India's civil aviation authority has ordered an investigation and suspended the crew of the jet, officials said. Because of a brutal new coronavirus wave, most states only allow 50 guests at weddings, but 161 friends and family of the newlyweds were on the jet. The couple, who have not been named, were married as the Spicejet plane flew over the historic Meenakshi Amman temple on its way from Madurai to Bangalore, the Hindustan Times newspaper said. Film and photos of the onboard celebrations were posted on social media. They show people with flowers around their necks and taking selfies, but could not be immediately verified by AFP. In breach of civil aviation rules, hardly any of them are wearing masks and social distancing rules are blatantly ignored. The Directorate General of Civil Aviation has told Spicejet to take action against the newlyweds and their guests, reports said. All could be banned from taking passenger flights. "The agent and the guest passengers were briefed in detail, both in writing as well as verbally, on social distancing and safety norms to be followed as per COVID-19 guidelines both at the airport and on board the aircraft throughout the journey," a Spicejet spokesperson told Indian media. "Despite repeated requests and reminders, the passengers did not follow COVID-19 guidelines and the airline is taking appropriate action as per rules," the official added.
