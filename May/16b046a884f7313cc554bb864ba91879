Prince Simakade Zulu, the other son of the late King Goodwill Zwelithini, has rubbished claims that he's opposing the appointment of the new AmaZulu King, Misuzulu. In a letter written to AmaZulu traditional prime minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Prince Simakade says he supports the endorsement of Prince Misizulu as the monarch.

Buthelezi is pleading with the public to stop spreading misleading information about the Royal family. This comes in the wake of social media speculation that the King is compelled to marry before he can issue royal decrees.

"The present speculation that his majesty is compelled to marry before he's installed suggests that our present government is mimicking what the apartheid regime imposed on our people," he said. "This is an inflammatory accusation that can cause deep distress. I'm not saying the king will not marry, it may be possible. "But him being not married could never stop him from ascending the throne or issuing royal decrees, he's already issuing them now. We can't do anything already without getting his permission and approval."
