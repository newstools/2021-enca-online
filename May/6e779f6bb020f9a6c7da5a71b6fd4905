Redefine properties' revenue continues to take a hit. JOHANNESBURG - Property companies are still taking a hammering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Redefine properties' revenue continues to take a hit. The owner of retail, officeÂ and industrial properties says that it saw a decline in its revenue during the second half of 2020. It's flagged the deconsolidation of its European Logistics Investment. The sale of its student accommodation properties in Australia and other non-core local properties also negatively impacted its revenue. The board says it's still deciding whether it will declare a dividend for the interim, or only at the end of its 2021 financial year.
