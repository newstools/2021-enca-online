Well, that's caused a striking turquoise water discolouration. "What's really happened here, we saw a few weeks ago, a mass shoal of fish come into our marina basin," said Donald Kau, the waterfront's Public Relations head. "They seemed to have been chased in by a bunch of whales. That's lead to a mass concentration fish, levels of oxygen dropped and you had this mass fish dying off." But there's positive news --Â local eco-warriors are hard at work to nurse the waters back to health. "We are drawing seawater into the canal that is then going to be introduced back into our marina," Kau said. * eNCA's Tanya Nefdt reports.
