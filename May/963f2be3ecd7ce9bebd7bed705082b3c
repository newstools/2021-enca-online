"I think if I had swum this evening as clean as I did this morning, I could have gone 58.3," Andrew said after his finals victory that came on the heels of his 58.82 performance in the heats. "There were a ton of mistakes, I was short on my turn and my foot broke on the surface on the breakout to come home. So there were a few things that I would have liked to have done differently but I felt really strong. "I'm a little bummed I didn’t get an American record," he said of coming up shy of Kevin Cordes' national mark of 58.64. "That's what I was going for, but I'm happy with it." The time put him fourth-fastest in the world this year, with Briton Adam Peaty's 57.39 topping the list in 2021.
