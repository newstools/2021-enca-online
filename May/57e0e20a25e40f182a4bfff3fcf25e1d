Zuma and French arms company Thales are charged in connection with a multi-billion-rand arms deal. READ: De Lille agrees to testify in Zuma, Thales case The case has been postponed many times and with Zuma’s legal team withdrawing its services from him, legal expert Ulrich Roux says the case is likely to be postponed again. "It's more of the same, it would seem, this matter has been dragging on since 2005. They've not been placed in funds so they, in other words, have not received adequate instructions from their client to proceed with the matter or there is a conflict of interest that prohibits them from proceeding with the matter. "We will have to wait and see, in this instance, why Mr Mabuza has withdrawn. Certainly "for ethical reasons" does sound as if there is a bit more to the story than what we have been led to believe," Roux said.
