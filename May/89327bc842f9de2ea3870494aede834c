Miss Mexico Andrea Meza is crowned Miss Universe 2021 in Hollywood, Florida WASHINGTON - Miss Mexico was crowned Miss Universe on Sunday in Florida, after fellow contestant Miss Myanmar used her stage time to draw attention to the bloody military coup in her country. Sunday night marked the Miss Universe competition's return to television, after the pageant was cancelled in 2020 for the first time due to the coronavirus pandemic. Andrea Meza, 26, finished first ahead of the Brazilian and Peruvian finalists in a flashy televised event, hosted by American actor Mario Lopez and television personality Olivia Culpo. Former Miss Universe contestants Cheslie Kryst, Paulina Vega and Demi-Leigh Tebow (who won the title in 2017) served as competition analysts and commentators, and a panel of eight women determined the winner.

Meza beat more than 70 contestants from around the globe in the 69th installment of Miss Universe, which was held at the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in Hollywood, Florida. In the days leading up to the final competition, Miss Myanmar Thuzar Wint Lwin, who made the top 21, made waves when she used her time in the spotlight to bring attention to the coup in her country.

"Therefore I would like to urge everyone to speak out about Myanmar." Miss Myanmar Thuzar Wint Lwin (pictured May 13, 2021) wore an outfit beaded in traditional Burmese patterns and held up a sign that said, "Pray for Myanmar" during the national costume portion of the Miss Universe pageant She also won the award for best national costume: during that competition segment on Thursday, she wore an outfit beaded in traditional Burmese patterns and held up a sign that said, "Pray for Myanmar." Myanmar has been in uproar since February 1, when the army ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. At least 796 people have been killed by security forces since then, according to a local monitoring group, while nearly 4,000 people are behind bars. Miss Singapore Bernadette Belle Ong -- who did not make the top 21 -- also used the national costume portion to make a political statement. Dressed in a glittering red bodysuit and matching thigh-high boots, she turned around to reveal her cape -- in the colors of the Singaporean flag -- was painted with the words "Stop Asian Hate." Miss Singapore Bernadette Belle Ong, pictured May 13, 2021, used her national costume to make a political statement at the Miss Universe competition "What is this platform for if I can't use it to send a strong message of resistance against prejudice and violence?" she wrote on Instagram alongside pictures of her outfit. The United States in particular has seen a surge in anti-Asian violence in the past year, which activists have blamed on former president Donald Trump's rhetoric, especially his repeated description of Covid-19 as the "China virus." The pageant has also drawn criticism in the past for objectifying the contestants. In recent years, the competition has shifted image, focusing more on female empowerment and activism.
