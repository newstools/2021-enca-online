The Eastern Cape Health Department says no one was informed that someone aboard a carrier vessel was displaying symptoms of COVID-19. That's after at least 14 crew members on board a bulk carrier that docked at the Gqeberha harbour tested positive for COVID-19. "We have confirmed that at least 14 crew members tested positive for COVID-19," said Sizwe Kupelo of the Eastern Cape Health Department. "Ten other crew members who were also subjected to testing tested negative." Kupelo said the situation seems to be under control.
