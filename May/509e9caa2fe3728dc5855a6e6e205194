READ: Zuma signs special plea affidavit Zuma argues that Downer's affidavit supports the DA's arguments in that case, which is at odds with the NPA's position at the time, that the prosecution had been irreparably tainted by political meddling. The former President contends Downer's siding in that matter, with a political party hostile to Zuma, disqualifies him from prosecuting the criminal case. He is understood to be pleading for an acquittal if his attempt to remove Downer is successful. The NPA says it is studying Zuma's plea and will respond in court. The prosecuting authority says at face value, Zuma's attempt to have Downer removed looks like a regurgitation of old issues already rejected by the courts.
