AFP/Mark Ralston JOHANNESBURG - South African batting star AB de Villiers has ruled out any chance of an international comeback, according to a statement issued by Cricket South Africa on Tuesday. Announcing the South African squads for a tour of the West Indies next month and Ireland in July, CSA stated: "Discussions with AB de Villiers have concluded with the batsman deciding, once and for all, that his retirement will remain final." There had been speculation that De Villiers, who retired from international cricket in 2018, would return in time to play in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for India in October and November.

De Villiers (37) said last month that he would make a decision based on his form and fitness. He had a good campaign for Royal Challengers Bangalore before COVID-19 caused the tournament to be halted. He scored 207 runs at an average of 51.75 with an outstanding strike rate of 164.28.

Mark Boucher was very clear that he was having conversations with AB. "Obviously he would always add value in whatever format he was playing, especially in a T20 World Cup, but I have not spoken to him personally and I have to respect the fact that he retired from international cricket."
