Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Inspector-General of Intelligence Sethlomamaru Dintwe alleges that Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo has been interfering in the office of the inspector general of intelligence. During an eNCA interview, Dintwe alleged that things were getting worse with the current administration. Dintwe says the political interference intensified once he expressed his intention to approach the Zondo Commission. WATCH: Three ministers didn't want me to testify: Dintwe "This includes the current minister, Minister Dlodlo, and the other ministers who are responsible for the other intelligence services ministers, that would be: Bheki Cele. "I have got letters where he was interfering, I also have letters that indicate the involvement of Minister [Nosiviwe] Mapisa-Nqakula who tried to micromanage me," he said. "I was very surprised yesterday [Tuesday], there were allegations that I followed Mr Arthur Fraser to Burundi. I've travelled extensively both in Africa and worldwide but I was never in Burundi. "Not before I have occupied this office and not after I have occupied this office. So these are the examples of the executives and the director-generals who follow me when I'm doing my work and if they run out of ideas, they start clutching on straws and making allegations such as I have a problem with alcohol."
