That's the word from KwaZulu-Natal premier, Sihle Zikalala. READ: The ANC should 'engage internally' over Zuma, says Zikalala Zikalala has pledged his support for the former president amid his corruption trial, which has been adjourned to later this month. "As the ANC, we want to make it clear that we want to negotiate and engage with the NEC and our attendance here today is based on the understanding that we stand with President Zuma, even today," he said.
