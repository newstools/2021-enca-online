Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The ANC says it hopes suspended Secretary-General Ace Magashule apologises publicly to the party and the public by the end of the week. The ANC NEC ordered Magasule to do so after he wrote a letter suspending ANC President Cyril Ramaphosa. Jessie Duarte briefed the media on the outcomes of the NEC meeting held over the weekend.

"The suspension will be reviewed from time to time but it is entirely dependant on the court case that the SG is facing," Duarte said.

On Monday, Ramaphosa slammed Magashule, saying such conduct has no place in the ruling party. "The NEC discussed the ‘letter of suspension’ written by the secretary-general to the president, for which the secretary-general had no authority or mandate from any structure of the movement," Ramaphosa said. "The NEC agreed that such conduct was completely unacceptable and a flagrant violation of the rules, norms and values of the ANC."
