Gang-rapes have also become more common in the rural town.
Crime statistics show the numbers of sexual offences and rapes have almost doubled when compared with the same period last year. READ: Crime stats: Murder cases up by 6.6% One woman shared the story of how she and her children endured a brutal home invasion this year.
"They took the cards, the birth certificate, and then took the phone and the groceries that were there. The three boys then raped me. When one of them had grabbed the 12-year-old child, another one said: Leave her, the child is still young.'"
A committee formed recently to support women who've suffered gender-based violence, says gang-rapes are increasing.
The Lusikisiki Gender-Based-Violence Committee's Khwalo Matandabuzo said, "this is liquor-related mainly because about 40 percent of these are done after people have consumed liquor, and then there's another one that's actually domestic-related into the families, family-related."
The area's traditional leadership said it's changed the way it deals with sexual violence cases. Inkosi Phathisizwe Mjoji said, "the rape cases have been there, but not reported, dealt with within the community. But now the change is that the people are aware and have been told that we can, as traditional leaders, we cannot deal with these cases unless they just directly report them, unless then they do not then ours as traditional community leaders, we need to report them for ourselves."
With a significant number of female-headed households in outlying areas, residents are calling for more visible policing.
