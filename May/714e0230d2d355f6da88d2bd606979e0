File: Money. eNCA JOHANNESBURG - The local currency has hit significant highs against the US dollar. A stronger rand exchange rate makes imports more affordable and tames inflation, including fuel price rises. READ: Rand at 16 month high against the dollar By the end of last week, the rand edged closer to the R14 to-the-dollar mark. Analysts say demand for the country’s mining commodities, higher interest rates, and a weaker dollar has led to the local currency making strong gains. The rand is over 30-percent stronger than it was a year ago when it traded at more than R18.50 to the US dollar.
