Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - AmaZulu Traditional Prime Minister Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi has rubbished allegations that the late Queen Regent Mantfombi Dlamini Zulu was poisoned. Buthelezi says some newspaper reports claim to be quoting him when he merely shared what the doctors had said. READ: AmaZulu Royal Household denies reports of family divisions "The issue of saying that merely when I passed what the doctors said the illness of the Queen, then this is interpreted as if i'm accusing anyone or any group in the Royal family of having poisoned the Queen," Buthelezi said. "I never said so... what actually caused the Queen's death, so far we don't know... I think it's important to clarify this matter because its very serious when people deliberately distort matter of such seriousness and a matter of grief to the nation, I've never accused anyone."
