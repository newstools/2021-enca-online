"I'm waiting for the SIU to finish their own report. There has been a preliminary investigation at the departmental level and the minister has briefed me and I'm now waiting to see how the SIU will conclude on this matter," he said. "I know that they are working quite fast to come up with a report and I would say that until that has been done, I'd like to be given the time to consider what they will come up with and thereafter we will be able to handle the matter." Ramaphosa and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron met on Friday.
