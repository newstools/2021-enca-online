Ambitious, fun and comfortable with who she was. That’s how Kgothatso Mdunana has been described by her family. She fell from the 13th-floor of a building to her death. Masego Rahlaga spoke to her parents. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - How does a happy young woman fall from the 13th floor of a building to her death? That's the question a bereaved South African family is asking. Kgothatso Mdunana (24) was studying civil engineering in China. Her family says the only information it has is that she was visiting a friend in Hangzhou on that fateful night -- a 15-hour train trip from where she lived. * eNCA's Masego Rahlaga reports.
