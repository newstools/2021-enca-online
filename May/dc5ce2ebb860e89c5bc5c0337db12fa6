He died last month, aged 99. In her speech, written by the government, the Queen detailed plans to "strengthen the economic ties across the union", in part by improving national infrastructure. The monarch's role is to stay above the political fray but the future of her kingdom could be at stake after the election results north of the border gave new impetus to the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP).
