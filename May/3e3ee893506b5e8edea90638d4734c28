AFP/Anne-Christine Poujoulat PARIS - With concert halls shut, one French mezzo-soprano decided to take her voice directly into people's homes as a way to stay connected, and has found herself performing to families, Alpine shepherds and a couple of cats. Professional opera singer Fiona McGown was used to performing on stage at least four times a month, and had been doing so since she was 12. When France shut all its cultural venues during a second wave of the pandemic in October, she decided to take matters into her own hands. "With my diary empty, I told myself that either I sit on the sofa, or I go find an audience in their own homes," she said.

Now her timetable is filling up, with seven performances in April and already five lined up for this month in Paris, Le Havre and Rennes. "At the start, it was very much word-of-mouth," she said. "Now, I've started getting requests by email and social media." That included a nurse, exhausted from her work, who asked McGown to come sing for her and her children.

It was in an artists' workshop in Aubervilliers that she found herself singing for a family and their two cats. "They didn't meow, but they started to fight when I sang Ravel. I just tried to stay focused," said McGown, laughing. McGown says she does indeed hope to continue with her new venture, even though her diary is rapidly filling up again with summer festival bookings. "Maybe once a month," she said with a smile.
