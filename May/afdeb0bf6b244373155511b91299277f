Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Rival factions in the ANC are squaring up for a showdown at this weekend’s NEC meeting with knives out for suspended secretary-general Ace Magashule. Magashule has been suspended for refusing to step aside despite facing criminal charges and on Wednesday night he hit back, issuing a notice suspending Ramaphosa in response. But Magashule’s actions have been dismissed out of hand as illegitimate.

"And try to accommodate each other’s views, then I think the ANC will avoid any form of split or division." * eNCA's Govan Whittles reports.
