Music fills Vienna's Musikverein as the Philharmonic orchestra returns. AFP/Celine Jankowiak VIENNA - Classical musicians in Vienna are preparing to return to live performances after long months without audiences which have severely tested their motivation and, for some, even thrown their careers into question. They are dusting off their instruments after Austria's easing of coronavirusÂ restrictions allowed cultural venues to open their doors again on May 19. Singers' agent Laurent Delage likens the challenge facing the musicians to "elite athletes who have to fire up the machine again" after a period of inactivity. Many musicians found some respite in such online performances, whether they were professionally produced or organised ad hoc by musicians themselves and broadcast on social media. Before the pandemic, Vienna -- one of the world's foremost centres of classical music -- played host to some 15,000 concerts a year. Daniel Froschauer, first violinist and chairman of the Vienna Philharmonic, says that streamed concerts during the pandemic have proved "incredible musical projects that kept me musically alive" after the "shock" of the first lockdown. But even Froschauer admits that those virtual concerts were "always a little bit unsatisfactory". "When you play for an audience, the feedback from the audience, that's something you cannot underestimate," he adds -- an experience he rediscovered earlier this month playing at Milan's La Scala.
