There are an estimated 4.5-million licenced firearms in South Africa and the vast majority of those are kept for self-defence purposes. eNCA’s Barry Bateman reports. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gun owners are furious as government revealed proposed changes to the law that would remove self-defence as a valid reason to own a firearm. The invitation for public comments on the Draft Firearms Control Amendment Bill was released on Friday night. Girls on Fire, which helps women lawfully license firearms for self-defence, says this could be a major blow to the fight against gender-based violence. READ: SAPS questioned on shambles at Central Firearms Registry offices Gun Owners SA says the proposed changes are a rehash of what was proposed -- and shot down -- in 2018. The public has until early July to submit their written comments on the Draft Bill to the Civilian Secretariat for Police. * eNCA’s Barry Bateman reports.
