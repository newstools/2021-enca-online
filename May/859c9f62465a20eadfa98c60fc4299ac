President Cyril Ramaphosa. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa has once again hit out at rich nations for not helping poorer countries inoculate their people. Speaking on the first day of the World Health Assembly, he said a joint effort is needed to end the pandemic. "At this year's World Health Assembly, we are urged to end this pandemic, prevent the next one and build a healthier, safer, and fairer world," he said.

Many people in wealthier nations have been vaccinated while billions of people in poorer countries still wait and are still vulnerable to infection, to disease and death." Ramaphosa says ensuring equitable access is not just a moral issue.
