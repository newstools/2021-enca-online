Carole King, The Go-Go's, Foo Fighters and Todd Rundgren round out the elite group of performers selected for induction into the rock pantheon, which in recent years has made efforts to broaden its acceptance of genre and honor more artists who aren't white men. This year the 1,200 voters responsibile for doling out the top rock awards appear to have taken to heart the perennial criticism that they were falling short. "This diverse class of talented inductees reflects the Rock Hall's ongoing commitment to honor artists whose music created the sound of youth culture," said John Sykes, Chairman of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame Foundation, in a statement. The 2021 class diverse in generation and genre should make for an eventful induction ceremony concert, which was forced to go virtual in its 35th edition that added The Notorious B.I.G. and Whitney Houston to the organization's ranks. The 36th annual ceremony is planned for October 30 in Cleveland, Ohio, where the Hall of Fame is based. Jay-Z, Foo Fighters and the Go-Go's are all first-time nominees; artists are eligible for nomination 25 years after the release of their first recording. The Go-Go's -- known for their 1980s punk-inflected dance pop -- have been eligible since 2006. Rap magnate Jay-Z -- whose hits include "99 Problems" and "Hard Knock Life" -- enters the Hall of Fame a 23-time Grammy winner, and the first hip hop artist inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Turner's entry into the hall comes after a year that saw her celebrated in an HBO documentary, which told her story of leaving her abusive husband Ike Turner, who was also her musical partner, before launching a successful solo career that includes hits like "What's Love Got to Do With It."
