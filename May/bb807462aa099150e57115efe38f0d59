The 32-year-old Irishman only fought once in 2020, earning around $22-million from his victory over Donald Cerrone in January. The bulk of the former plumber's pay packet -- an estimated $158-million -- came via his successful business activities, which included the sale of his Proper Twelve whiskey brand. McGregor was one of only four athletes to earn more than $100-million in 2020, according to the Forbes annual list of sport's highest earners. Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi was second on the list with $130-million in earnings, followed by Juventus idol Cristiano Ronaldo with $120-million.
