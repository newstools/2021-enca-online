Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Smaller political parties are wanting a vote in the Section 194 inquiry that will decide on the Public Protector’s fitness to hold office. Led by the UDM, they're proposing a weighted voting system in the committee that will start an impeachment process against Busisiwe Mkhwebane READ: Parliament names MPs for Public Protector probe As per National Assembly rules, the committee will comprise 11 voting and 15 non-voting members, the latter mostly from the minority parties. The ANC and the DA are strongly opposed to the new voting proposal. They say it would undermine the electoral result. READ: Public Protector's report on Des Van Rooyen set aside The Freedom Front Plus says the ANC has been fair in allowing broad representation on the committee. Besides, parties will get to vote as per their electoral representation when the inquiry outcome is referred to the house for final consideration. Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli said: “Unfortunately Mr Kwankwa, you have not persuaded members of the rules committee. But there’s an indication that there may be a case at a later stage to review the rules. "As you are suggesting certain options be taken, but it’s very clear that the request for us to do this now has not won the day if I may put it that way. But it’s not for me to make that decision, as you know the speaker referred this to the rules committee to discuss so that when she makes a determination, she has an understanding of the view of the rules committee.”
