Police Minister Bheki Cele and National Police Commissioner Khehla Sitole. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - The battle over the appointment of senior officers in the SAPS is heating up. Minister Bheki Cele has signalled his opposition to the appointment of senior managers through a letter to the National Police Commissioner Kehla Sitole. READ: Cele instructs Sitole to retract senior management appointments Cele says he doesn't support the appointment of Yolisa Mokgabudi as the Divisional Head for Crime Intelligence, and as far as he's concerned, Mokgabudi is still the Western Cape Provincial Commissioner.
