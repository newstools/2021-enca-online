AFP/Markus Schreiber BERLIN - Germany's "historic" coronavirus crisis will extend into 2021 even if the vaccines bring some hope, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said. Merkel denounced the conspiracy theories advanced by virus sceptics as not just "false and dangerous" but "cynical and cruel" towards those who had suffered during the pandemic. "These days and these weeks... are difficult times for our country," Merkel warned. "And that is going to last for a good while yet."

"I can only imagine the bitterness felt by those who are mourning a loved one because of the coronavirus, or those who are still suffering its after-effects, when the existence of the virus is disputed or denied by some," she said. "The conspiracy theories are not only false and dangerous, they are also cynical and cruel towards these people," she added.
