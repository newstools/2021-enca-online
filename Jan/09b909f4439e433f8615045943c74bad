AFP/Marco Bertorello ROME - Italy postponed the reopening of its ski resorts until later this month after regional authorities asked for more time to meet coronavirus regulations. The ordinance signed by Health Minister Roberto Speranza delays the reopening the country's ski lifts and facilities until 18 January. Authorities in Italy's northern and central regions had alerted the government that a planned 7 January opening date was not realistic.

The Italian government's scientific technical committee, which advises on COVID-19 rules, had signalled "medium-high" risk of crowds, inside gondolas, as well as at lift lines and during après-ski.
