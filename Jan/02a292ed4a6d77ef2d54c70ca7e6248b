Young entrepreneurs in Khayelitsha in Cape Town opened a bicycle shop that serves the community. Khaltsha Cycles in Khayelitsha is all about living a healthy lifestyle and community development. Juma Mkwele said, “in this community, there has never been a bike shop so we felt there was a need for us to bring a bike shop we turned it into a bike hub that not only sells bicycles but also to maintain bicycles. Two shot." "We felt there was a need for people to have access to bicycles for people to go to work or for the kids to go to school or just for exercising.” Mkwele says since they opened five months ago, more than 1,000 people have come into the shop. 20 bicycles have been sold and more than 100 bicycles have been repaired. You can also hire a bike for a few hours a day. Mkwele said, “during the lockdown people looking for activities to do so cycling was part of the exercise that people needed to do during lockdown so that is the journey that made us through to be where we are today.” Cyclist Loyiso Mpondo said, “Khaltsha Cycles is a hub where you can come and fix your bike and come and chill and we also have tours sunset tours for Thursdays and Saturday rides here.” 100 bicycles, helmets and masks have been donated to these young ones which means they will be able to ride to school. Those who have physical challenges are also given an opportunity to be part of the group and even the not-so-young can be taught to pedal.
