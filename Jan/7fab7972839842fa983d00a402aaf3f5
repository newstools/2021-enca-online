Justin Shonga of Orlando Pirates celebrates goal during the Absa Premiership 2018/19 matchÂ at the Suger Ray Xulu Stadium, Clermont on the 2 March 2019. CAPE TOWN CITY - Former Orlando Pirates striker, Justin Shonga has joined Cape Town City following his short stint with top-flight newcomers, Tshakhuma FC. The Zambian joined Tshakuma from Orlando Pirates before the start of the season. However, his stay at the Limpopo outfit proved not to be a fruitful one. He's played seven matches across all competitions for Tshakhuma this season and hit the back of the net once in the process. At the Citizens, Shonga will join up with his countryman Charles Zulu. Zulu joined the tea from seven-time Zambian champions, Zanaco two months ago. Just like Shonga, Zulu is part of the Zambia national team.
