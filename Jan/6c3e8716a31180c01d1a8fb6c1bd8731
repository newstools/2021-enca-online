Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Since the coronavirus outbreak, hospital visits have been prohibited, making it difficult for families to check on the status of their loved ones. Netcare has launched a support line to keep next of kin informed. Group CEO Dr Richard Friedland explained how the Family Connect Line works. "The levels of anxiety are almost debilitating and it's often difficult [for family members] to phone our wards to hear our nurses who are dressed up PPE, masks and in visors.

"A dedicated professional will get back to the family on daily basis with an update and we think this will bring a lot of reassurance both to patients and their families for those that can't communicate." The number (080 011 1266) will be operational from 8am to 6pm from Monday to Friday and from 8am to 5pm on Saturdays and Sundays.
