 A day of celebration for the community as they begin restoring the St Lucia Estuary mouth. The estuary has been under threat. It’s hoped that now, with the intervention from the community and iSimangaliso Wetland Park, the estuary will once again flourish. Mawande Kheswa has more.

It has been an ongoing ecological problem, caused by climate change and farming activities along the Mfolosi flood plain, meaning too much silt flowed into the lake. Falling within the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, the lake was South Africa’s first World Heritage Site, making it an area for tourism. Watch the video above for more details on this story.
