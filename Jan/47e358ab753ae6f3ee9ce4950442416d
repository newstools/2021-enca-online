Tembisa Hospital. JOHANNESBURG - The South African Medical Association says there is a massive problem with the healthcare system in the country. Sama says appropriate action must be taken against those involved in the death of businessman Shonisani Lethole. The 34-year-old COVID-19 patient was starved for nearly 4 days, left unattended, and subsequently died at the facility. READ: Calls for Tembisa Hospital CEO to be suspended "This is what is happening all around in our healthcare systems because I mean, what you observed there, you observe that the doctor's notes were lost so there is some information that is missing. I think six days worth of notes were found to be missing," said Sama's Mvuyisi Mzukwa. "On top of that we find a very strange thing happening in these hospitals where you find clinicians are expected to do administrative work in most cases, especially when the clinicians are working at night." On Wednesday, The Health Ombud released a report into Lethole's death and the state of the hospital. He found hospital staff to have been negligent.
