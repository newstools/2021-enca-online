Fita Chairman Sinen Mnguni spoke with eNCA anchor Jeremy Maggs. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The Fair-Trade Independent Tobacco Association said the government's tobacco sales ban appeal is regrettable. The government is appealing a High Court ruling which found the ban unnecessary. READ: Government to appeal tobacco ban ruling The government banned the use of tobacco sales during the hard lockdown last year. The tobacco company approached the Western Cape High Court to overturn the ban. The Minister of Cooperative Government and Traditional Affairs (COGTA), Dr Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, together with the president, has decided to go to the Supreme Court of Appeal to appeal the decision. Fita Chairman Sinen Mnguni said the association is concerned another ban may be announced. "We are a bit concerned because it leaves fertile ground now for government to potentially implement another cigarette ban." Mnguni said another ban would be a nail in the coffin of the legitimate cigarette industry in South Africa. "As things currently stand, we are battling as the market currently is flooded with illicit cigarettes from our neighbouring countries," Mnguni said. He said another ban would further entrench illicit cigarette sales.
