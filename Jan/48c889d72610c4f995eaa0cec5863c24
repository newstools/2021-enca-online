Courtesy #DStv403  CAPE TOWN - A Western Cape mother has one wish: She wants the police officer who allegedly killed her son to be arrested. Reginald Petersen was shot dead a week ago in front of his family in the small town of Prince Alfred Hamlet. His family says police officers allegedly used maximum force on Petersen after his sister called them over an argument she had with her brother. Petersen -- who was the sole breadwinner -- was apparently shot several times and died on the scene. His mother Siena Petersen says when officers arrived, they allegedly threw tear gas canisters into the house to force her son out. Petersen wants the officer who allegedly killed her son to be arrested. Residents and community leaders believe officers were heavy-handed in their approach to subdue one man. “The community is resentful and they are hurt," said the CPF's Koos Bantam. "A precedent has been set by certain police officers, which is unacceptable. I believe if they called in back-up before they started shooting, we could’ve avoided one death.” Police watchdog IPID says it’s investigating the incident. * eNCA's Monique Mortlock reports.
