READ: One shot, two beheaded in Shallcross Two victims, who were beheaded, were killed in an act of mob violence after allegedly shooting the first victim to death. SAPS spokesperson Brigadier Jay Naicker explained some of the tensions in the area, "The drug issue in this area is always going to be a problem because of the high level of drug usage, Shallcross has the most lucrative market for high level of drug usage." "In fact, years back there was a huge turf war in this area <Shallcross> fighting this market, it subsided but never stopped." "We are convinced it will continue, there are now many units including the Hawks that are investigating drug usage in this area."  Detectives have returned to the Shallcross home of suspected drug lord Yaganathan “Teddy Mafia” Pillay. He was shot in the head and killed yesterday. His alleged attackers were beheaded and burnt, allegedly by Pillay’s allies. #eNCA pic.twitter.com/qDzjoefnPi
