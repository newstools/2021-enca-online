Breaking with members of his party, Donald Trump had criticised the defense bill on numerous grounds. AFP/Saul Loeb WASHINGTON - The US Congress dealt Donald Trump a humiliating blow in his last days in office with the Senate voting overwhelmingly to override his veto of a sweeping defense bill -- the first time lawmakers have done so during his presidency. By a lopsided vote of 81-13, well more than the two-thirds of the 100-member chamber required, the Republican-controlled Senate approved the $740.5-billion National Defense Authorization Act to fund the military for the fiscal year 2021.

Both houses of Congress had easily passed the legislation in early December by strong majorities, but Trump, citing a litany of objections, vetoed it on 23 December. "It's time for us to deliver this bill," Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said at the start of Friday's session.

The vote completed a stunning rebuke in the waning weeks of Trump's presidency. It came in an extraordinary New Year's Day session necessitated by his veto, possibly the final act of the outgoing Congress. New members will be sworn in on Sunday, just 17 days before Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated to succeed Trump.
