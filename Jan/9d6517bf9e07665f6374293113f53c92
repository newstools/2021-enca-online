JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng Education MEC, Panyaza Lesufi has reiterated that no learners are allowed at school and that schools that want to migrate to online teaching can do so. Lesufi says he will urge the Basic Education Minister to gazette the two week school reopening delay. READ: Lesufi updates on Gauteng school placement process "Any other school, whether private, independent or public that is operating in Gauteng, they are in defiance of the state and if they are in defiance of the state, we will persuade them to a certain limit, if they don't want to be persuaded beyond that limit, unfortunately we will have to act," he said. "In acting we will find a mechanism within the law to act appropriately." The MEC was visiting Helpmekaar College in Braamfontein on Monday.
