Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - It was an uncharacteristically quiet New Year's Eve with widespread compliance with lockdown regulations in Johannesburg's inner city. Hillbrow residents were off the streets and indoors before the 9pm curfew, resulting in very few arrests. The lights on the Nelson Mandela Bridge were switched off in a moment of silence for those who have lost their lives to COVID-19 and those who continue to battle it on the frontlines. * eNCA's Michael Appel reports.
