Berlin has long been known as a bike-friendly city, but a sharp rise in the number of cyclists has been causing tensions on the road. AFP/John MacDougall BERLIN -Â It's rush hour on a grey morning in Berlin and a stream of cyclists are gliding along Friedrichstrasse, the fabled shopping street that runs through the city centre. "Move!" one of them yells after illegally mounting the pavement and charging at a defenceless pedestrian. Bernd Lechner, a 40-year-old insurance clerk, manages to dodge the speeding bike just in time, but he's had enough of the "increasingly aggressive" attitude of cyclists in the German capital. "It's getting worse and worse. I'm starting to become more scared of bicycles than of cars," he said. Berlin has long been known as a bike-friendly city, but a sharp rise in the number of cyclists during the coronavirus pandemic has been causing tensions on the road. The number of Berliners cycling to work or to go shopping has increased by some 25 percent since the start of the pandemic, according to city authorities. All good news for fitness, air quality and public health, since it reduces the number of people using public transport during the fight against COVID-19. But at the same time, police have registered a sharp rise in the number of offences committed by cyclists and a surge in complaints about them from pedestrians, according to Berlin police chief Barbara Slowik.
