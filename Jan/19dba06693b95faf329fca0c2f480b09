Bairstow, a regular in the limited-overs England side, last played a five-day game in December 2019 but is expected to make the starting XI in the two-Test series starting in Galle on January 14. Bairstow scored a century in his last one-day international and then amassed 345 runs in the IPL Twenty20 tournament for Sunrisers Hyderabad between September-November. Bairstow said playing top spinners including Rashid Khan, Mohammad Nabi and Indian players in the Hyderabad squad for six to eight weeks in the IPL was "great, to be honest". "Coming into similar conditions, we haven't got a long run-in," the wicketkeeper-batsman told reporters after his team's second training session in Hambantota. "So calling those experiences, whether that be when we went to Bangladesh when we went to playing India or another couple of tours - they all come into it." Bairstow, who has played 70 Tests at a batting average of under 35, said he enjoys batting at number three but was open to playing in any position in the order. "I've batted in different places over a period of time. Wherever it is I do bat if I do get the nod, hopefully, I'm well enough equipped to make the best of that opportunity," said Bairstow. "(The) last time I played in Sri Lanka, I got a hundred batting at three. I think I've battled a few times at three and generally done alright there. If that is the case, then bring it on."
