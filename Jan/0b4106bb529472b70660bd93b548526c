Religious leaders in Sebokeng said there were no consultations with the government regarding the new lockdown regulations on church gatherings. CRL chairperson, Professor David Mosoma says the main focus should be saving lives, rather than squabbling with authorities. "We must understand here that the role of leaders is to take decisions," says Mosoma.

Mosoma went on to say that if the government spent time consulting on everything, nothing would get done. "People are dying every day, even funeral parlours say they are not coping," says Mosoma.
