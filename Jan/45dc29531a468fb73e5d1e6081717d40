US actor/musician Jared Leto arrives for the 2019 LACMA Art+Film Gala at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in Los Angeles. NEW YORK - Video-on-demand service Apple TV + has commissioned a miniseries based on the saga of WeWork, the shared office giant that almost went bankrupt after becoming a darling of Wall Street, with Jared Leto playing the role of its colorful former boss Adam Neumann. "WeCrashed: The Rise and Fall of WeWork," will follow "the greed-filled rise and inevitable fall of WeWork, one of the world's most valuable startups, and the narcissists whose chaotic love made it all possible," Apple TV+ said in a statement. Founded in 2010, WeWork was built on the model of shared office space, combining both flexibility and user-friendliness. A start-up with a dynamic and innovative image, WeWork quickly won over investors, reaching a theoretical valuation of $47 billion in January 2019. The group was preparing its entry on the New York Stock Exchange with great fanfare, but within weeks it suffered a catastrophic downturn and had to cancel.

To save WeWork from bankruptcy, its main shareholder, Japan's Softbank, had to inject several billion dollars and shunted Adam Neumann aside. Oscar-winner Jared Leto, long accustomed to colorful roles, will play Neumann alongside Anne Hathaway, also an Oscar winner, who plays Neumann's wife and WeWork co-founder Rebekah, who has a personality as volatile as her husband's. She, too, had to leave the group in 2019.
