State Security Agency's Acting DG, Loyiso Jafta has taken the stand at the State Capture Inquiry. JOHANNESBURG – State Security Agency (SSA) money was used to fund factional political activity in the ANC, according to the agency's acting director-general, Loyiso Jafta. Jafta has taken the stand at the state capture inquiry after State Security Minister Ayanda Dlodlo's attempts to stop him were dismissed. "There are monies that left the agency for the purposes of funding political activity principally within the African National Congress," said Jafta. "And often when you drill into it, it's not funding the African National Congress credibly, it is to fund activities of a particular faction within the African National Congress."
