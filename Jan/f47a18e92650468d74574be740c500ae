JOHANNESBURG - The Zondo Commission will continue to hear testimony about the State Security Agency. It will be from an unidentified witness. WATCH: Explosive claims about ANC at state capture inquiry On Tuesday, SSA acting director-general Loyiso Jafta told the inquiry that agency funds were used to fund ANC factions. There was awkward drama before his testimony when his boss, State Security Minister, Ayanda Dlodlo tried to stop him testifying. Commission chair Raymond Zondo dismissed that application for a postponement, saying Dlodlo had enough time to articulate her specific concerns but hadn't done so.
