Shawn "Jay-Z" Carter, already a cannabis entrepreneur, will serve as "chief visionary officer" of The Parent Company (TPCO), which aims "to help rectify the wrongs of cannabis prohibition."

The fund launches at a time when US states have legalised marijuana use, and more cannabidiol products have become ubiquitous, sparking an investment frenzy. "This is an incredible time for this industry. The end of cannabis prohibition is here, and The Parent Company will lead the charge to a more expansive and inclusive cannabis industry," Jay-Z said in the statement. In addition to the initial target of $10-million in The Parent Company Social Equity Ventures the company plans to provide "an annual contribution of at least 2 percent of net income" to the industry. TPCO, formerly Subversive Capital Acquisition, was formed through a tie-up of direct-to-consumer cannabis platform Caliva, Jay-Z's Roc Nation and Left Coast Ventures.
