This is the second marker dying in the province due to COVID-19 since the beginning of the marking process. Last weekend, a female marker passed away in Escourt. WATCH: The rise of online learning amid COVID-19 KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu has confirmed she was based at the Inanda Seminary School in Durban.
Umlazi Comtech is one of the 30 marking centres in KZN. More than 300 markers are working here.
Authorities have been on a site visit and say they're happy with the marking process so far. Following the death of two markers, the Education MEC says ensuring that the marking centres are safe is crucial.
KZN Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said, "we will continue, as the Department, to make sure that all our marking centres remain declared as safe marking centres. Each and every marking centre is assigned a compliance officer who reports to the head office on daily basis in terms of the compliance measures. So we do believe that we will be able to pull through until the last day of the marking". READ: Matric exams: DBE satisfied with marking progress Premier Sihle Zikalala joined the site visit and expressed his appreciation for the markers and their work. He also used the occasion to comment on the president's lockdown extension.
Zikalala said, "we believe that the extension of Level 3 will help us to curb the spread. KwaZulu-Natal is one of those in fact it is the leading province on new cases and therefore we believe this will give us an opportunity to focus on ensuring that we deal with testing and contact tracing which is quite important."
Marking of the matric exams is expected to be concluded on Sunday.
