AFP/Joel Saget PARIS - Millions in France faced tightened curfew restrictions to combat a high rate of coronavirus cases, as police booked hundreds of New Year revellers for flouting anti-Covid measures at an illegal rave in the country. The French government, facing the threat of a new wave of COVD-19 infections, extended a nighttime curfew by two hours in parts of the country to help combat the virus. The curfew will start at 6pm, rather than 8pm in 15 of France's 101 departments, most of them in the country's east.

The curfew restrictions came as an illegal rave in northwestern France ended on Saturday after more than two days of partying that saw clashes with police. Around 800 people were booked for flouting anti-virus measures, while the regional health authority in Brittany noted the "high risk of the spread of COVID-19" at the event. "We knew what we were risking... we had to party, for a year everything has been stuck," said one of the revellers, a 20-year-old waitress.
