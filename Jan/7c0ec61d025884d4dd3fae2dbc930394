File: The six-month-old cub does not want to be separated from her keeper. AFP/Hsu Tsun-hsu SEOUL - Video footage of an adorable baby giant panda clinging desperately to her zookeeper's leg in South Korea has garnered more than four million hits on YouTube. In the viral clip the zookeeper weighs little Fu Bao on a scale and then places the baby panda on the floor in an enclosure at the Everland Zoo near Seoul. But it seems the six-month-old cub -- whose name means "a treasure that gives happiness" -- does not want to be separated from her keeper. Fu Bao wraps her front paws around his leg, clinging on even as he tries to walk away. She is carried across the room until the zookeeper bends down to untangle his leg from Fu Bao's grip. The persistent cub tries to grab him once again before she gives up and rolls over in retreat. The near two-minute-long video shows the zookeeper placing the baby panda next to a pile of bamboo leaves before walking away. Fu Bao was born last year to a pair of giant pandas presented to South Korea by Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2016. A video of a baby giant panda clinging to a zookeeper's leg in South Korea has gone viral, with more than 4 million people viewing it on YouTube.Â The Straits Times
