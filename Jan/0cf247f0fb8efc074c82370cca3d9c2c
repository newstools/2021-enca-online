The update sparked criticism among users as they must accept the changes or see their access to the service -- which also allows encrypted voice and video calls -- cut off from 8 February. Sizwe Snail ka Mtuze, of the Information Regulator of SA said, "We have a law that protects citizens personal information it is called the POPI Act and this act prohibits the processing of personal information that is deemed unlawful." "One of the concerns that we may have as the regulator concerning these terms and conditions is that the consent that you give has to be lawful... It can’t be a situation of you either agree or we let you go. The POPIA also talks about the consent needing to be voluntary and specific, so these are some of the issues we'd like to address with Facebook. the regulator has already contacted the offices of Facebook of SA and will be engaging on what the terms and conditions that have been placed there." The Information Regulator said its engagement with Facebook is still in the initial stages.
