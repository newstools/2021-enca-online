AFP/Sameer Al-Doumy BERLIN - Deliveries of the coronavirus vaccine developed by BioNTech and Pfizer to EU nations will be delayed in the coming weeks because of works at the US pharma firm's plant in Belgium, Germany's health ministry said Friday. "At short notice, the EU Commission and, via it, the EU member states, were informed that Pfizer will not be able to fully meet the already promised delivery volume for the next three to four weeks due to modifications at the Puurs plant," the ministry said.

Germany said it "took note of this very last minute and unexpected news with regret", particularly so because the delivery dates up to mid-February had been set by the companies themselves. It added that it "expects the EU commission to seek clarity and certainty for further deliveries and delivery dates from Pfizer as soon as possible". The delay would be made up for from mid-February, as the ministry said the promised quantities of vaccines for the first quarter would be fully delivered during the first three months of the year.
