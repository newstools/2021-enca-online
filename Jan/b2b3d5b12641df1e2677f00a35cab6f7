President Cyril Ramaphosa revealed this at the weekend. READ: Jan 8 statement: ANC sidesteps Magashule issue The ANC's integrity commission has recommended that Secretary-General Ace Magashule step aside. "The ANC has never, in its entire history, faced a situation where its Secretary-General has been charged criminally," says Duarte. "There is then an element of how long is a 'step aside'," she adds. According to Duarte, the commission understands that they need guidelines and cannot accept a resolution that tells you to step aside. The ANC is the custodian of justice and will always work to protect the constitution of the country. That's the word from ANC Deputy Secretary-General, Jessie Duarte. #SAMorning #DStv403 pic.twitter.com/lrNpAAGv7Z Duarte also believes ANC is the custodian of justice and will always work to protect the constitution of the country. She says ANC's resolutions stand against any form of corruption and graft will never be tolerated within the party. Watch the video above for more details on this story.
