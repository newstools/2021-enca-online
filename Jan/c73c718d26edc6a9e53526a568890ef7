It is threatening legal action if the President fails to provide a detailed plan for the vaccine's rollout. READ: Mkhize: SA to receive 1m vaccine doses in January "The president's reply will have to provide the full rollout and administration programme, which has to include all the vaccine types, the number of required doses and the dates that these will be available, as well as how they will be stored and transported," said DA leader, John Steenhuisen. "If the president provides satisfactory answers all the questions put to him in the letter, then we will work together with him to ensure that the programme has the very best chance of success." Health Minister, Zweli Mkhize announced earlier this month that one million doses of a COVID-19 vaccine will be rolled out in January. A further 500,000 vaccines will be received in February.
