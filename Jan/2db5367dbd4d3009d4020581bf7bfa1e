For more, @Thembikile Mrototo speaks to Professor Mosa Moshabela, dean and head of Nursing and Public Health School at UKZN. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng is likely to enter the peak of the second wave in two weeks' time, according to Professor Mosa Moshabela, dean and head of Nursing and Public Health School at UKZN. Moshabela says the exponential increase can be attributed to movements during the December holidays. He is warning that it would get worse before it gets better. READ: Ramaphosa, NCCC to meet stakeholders over COVID-19 spike "My sense is that Gauteng is unlikely to peak in the next week, we can expect perhaps in the next two weeks for Gauteng to peak and only then can we then begin to see a clear downward trend," he said. "We know that the peak of the second wave is going to be much higher than for the first wave and we know at the moment that it is showing signs that it is almost twice as high. My fear and concern is that it can get worse." The country has been recording more than 20,000 new infections over the past few days.
