Health authorities are worried that the thousands who were stuck there could be infected with coronavirus. JOHANNESBURG - The long queues of people waiting to cross into South Africa from Zimbabwe at Beitbridge are clearing. But, health authorities are worried that the thousands who were stuck there could be infected with coronavirus. So far, 104 positive cases were detected at the border post. Most people were not wearing masks, and there was no social distancing or hand sanitising.

It's a fact, if you are sitting together without mask, without sanitising, without social distance you will be infected, that's not a lie. So, those 104 has infected thousands of those who were there," said Phophi Ramathuba, Limpopo Health MEC. After almost a week, immigration authorities, the SAPS, SANDF and health authorities finally cleared the long queues. Security remains very tight at the border - with almost daily arrests and deportations of those without proper documentation. Watch the video above
