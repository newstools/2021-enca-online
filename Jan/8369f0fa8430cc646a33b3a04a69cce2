File: The rand exchanged hands 0.15 percent stronger at R15.05 against the greenback earlier in the day from an overnight close of R15.08. eNCA JOHANNESBURG - The market reacted overwhelmingly positive on Thursday following news that the Democrats had won the control of the US Senate. Analysts generally assume a Democrat-controlled Senate will be a net positive for economic growth globally and thus for most risk assets, but negative for bonds and the dollar as the US budget and trade deficits may widen further. The rand exchanged hands 0.15 percent stronger at R15.05 against the greenback earlier in the day from an overnight close of R15.08. “Markets reacted positively to news out of Georgia that Democrats gained control of the Senate,” said Axi markets analyst Milan Kutkovic. “While a Blue Wave could pave the way for stricter regulations and tax hikes, investors try to see it from a positive side: Further stimulus measures are likely to follow and without a months-long stalemate.” The All Share Index rose 0.56 percent to 62 200.98 points while the JSE Top40 Index followed suit, inching up 0.56 percent to 57 193.78. Government bonds also firmed, with the yield on the benchmark 2030 bond down 2 basis point at 8.665 percent. However, the rand’s march was halted by record numbers of COVID-19 infections and deaths in the last 24 hours, with cases rising by 21,832 and deaths by 844. By 11am on Thursday morning, it had retreated slightly to R15.11 against the greenback.
