The Mother City’s skies have been lit up over the past few days with a guiding light. Thirty-six vertical searchlights, each measuring close to a metre wide, were used to create one powerful beam of light. Tanya Nefdt reports. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - The Mother City’s skies have been lit-up over the past few days with a guiding light. Social media has been flooded with incredible sightings of this beam, lighting up Cape Town at around 9pm. Behind it, is an initiative by the V&A Waterfront to bring some inspiration after a tough 2020. The Beam of Hope, as it’s called, is just that -- something shining a beacon of light on compassion. The last time these lights were used was at the final of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. It can be spotted from as far as Blouberg and Melkbosstrand some 30 kilometres away.
