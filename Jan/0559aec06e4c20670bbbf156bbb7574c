The ANC’s NEC meeting focused solely on how the party wants to position itself in an election year and how it views the government response to COVID-19. The party says a report recommending that ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule step aside, didn’t feature. Govan Whittles reports. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The ANC says the January 8 statement will cement its identity as a movement of the people, and respond to South Africa's most pressing issues. But the party won’t be announcing what it will do with senior leaders implicated in corruption. The ANC NEC meeting this week sidestepped the issue. READ: Jan 8 statement: ANC NEC under pressure “The ANC will use this occasion to reaffirm our collective commitment to the resolutions of the 54th national conference," said Nomvula Mokonyane, ANC Head of Organising. "It is a platform to reassert the ANC as a movement rooted amongst the people and as a leader of society. It is a moment to draw on the legacy of the founding mothers and fathers of the ANC.” The party says a report recommending that ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule step aside, didn’t feature.
