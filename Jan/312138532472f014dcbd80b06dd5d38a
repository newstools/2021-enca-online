Acting CEO of Postbank, Hannes van der Merwe spoke with eNCA's Jeremy Maggs. Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Social Development Minister Lindiwe Zulu says government is in talks with stakeholders to replace South African Social Security Agency cards after a security breach, which was first reported in 2019. Although Sassa doesn't manage the cards, Zulu says it's one of the agency's priorities to intervene in instances of fraud or corruption.

"We need to replace 8,7 million cards. The reason why it's necessary to replace the cards that were issued in 2018 was that there was a security breach." The cards' master-key system, which encrypts the pin and access codes of the cards, was compromised, according to Van der Merwe, requiring the replacement of the cards. There has been no personal beneficiary information breach and no Sassa grant recipients have lost money as a result of the security breach, he said.
