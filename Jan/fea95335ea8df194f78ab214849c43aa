The organisation said companies should offer discounts to the government for the COVID-19 vaccine, as they should not be capitalising from the pandemic. "We believe, as the SACC, that this vaccine is moment for public good," says the SACC's Mzwandile Molo.

Molo says government must work hard to engage pharmaceutical companies to create private and public partnerships that ensure that the vaccine is not a place of exploitation.  The South African Council of Churches says government must negotiate with big pharma for a discount on the COVID-19 vaccine. It says this will ensure that everyone can have access.
