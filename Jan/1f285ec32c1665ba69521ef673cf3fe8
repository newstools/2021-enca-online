READ: RAF warns of major revenue losses Collins Letsoalo, CEO of the Road Accident Fund said the fund is dealing with a sometimes 10-year backlog on outstanding payouts.
Letsoalo said, "<there are a> multitude of variables, someone submits a claim with not enough information for us to assess it. Someone submits a claim and at a certain point, there are other people who go to court so you can't actually determine the time period when you can settle those claims." "We have set ourselves to settle these claims within 120 days and that's exactly what we are doing. We are starting with the oldest claims." The CEO stated the organisation hopes to rectify the situation within two years.
