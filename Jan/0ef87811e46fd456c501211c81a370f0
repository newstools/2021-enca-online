(Pixabay/Auk002) JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s major domestic one-day cricket competition will be played at a single venue with a reduced programme to minimise the spread of COVID-19, Cricket South Africa announced on Sunday. The six franchise Momentum Cup teams will stay in a bio-secure base in Potchefstroom. They will be split into two groups, each playing a single round of pool matches, followed by semi-finals and a final. The pools will be contested at different times so that there are no more than three teams at a time in the ‘bubble’.
