AFP/Carl de Souza RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil rang in the New Year with Rio de Janeiro's famed Copacabana beach nearly empty -- the usual swarms of revellers kept away by police because of the pandemic -- and pot-banging protests against far-right President Jair Bolsonaro. Rio usually hosts one of the world's biggest New Year's Eve parties, but authorities cancelled the festivities this year as COVID-19 racked the country.
