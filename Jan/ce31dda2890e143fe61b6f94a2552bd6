The title-holders were clinging to a one-point lead in a sixth-round thriller when they conceded a scrum penalty as the clock ticked to 80 minutes. Up stepped England-born Province fly-half Tim Swiel to score off an angled penalty from between the 22 and 10-metre lines and snatch victory for the visitors from Cape Town. Defeat meant the Cheetahs remained fifth in the standings with one match to play, away to the Griquas, and out of contention for a semi-finals place. Province, whose last-gasp victory kept them second, seemed to be cruising to victory when they led 23-9 after 53 minutes on an overcast evening. But 17 minutes, later a Cheetahs side that had battled in the scrums for much of the match was 26-23 ahead following tries from hooker Wilmar Arnoldi and winger Rosko Specman. A pushover Province try by hooker Bongi Mbonambi put them back in front only for the man of the match, Cheetahs centre Francois Steyn, to kick a penalty and give the hosts a 29-28 advantage. Swiel then slotted his seventh penalty to win a match that had been a kick fest for so long before delivering a dramatic climax. "I am gutted," admitted two-time World Cup winner Steyn as he battled to hold back tears while accepting the man-of-the-match award. "Nothing seems to be going our way. We fought so hard to get in front only to lose at the death. It is a bitterly disappointing outcome."
