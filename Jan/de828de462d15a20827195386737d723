Clary NEW YORK - A portrait by Italian renaissance painter Sandro Botticelli sold for $92-million at an online Sotheby's auction, smashing the record price for the artist. "Young Man Holding a Roundel," believed to have been painted in the 1470s or 1480s, is considered one of Botticelli's finest portraits and is the highlight of Sotheby's Masters Week sale in New York. "This is a work that transcends time and categories. Now we really do know the price of beauty," said George Wachter, co-chairman of old master paintings at Sotheby's. The 58cm by 39cm painting shows a man in his late teenage years with long golden hair sitting holding a disc featuring a bearded saint. The roundel, which depicts the saint with his right hand raised, is an original 14th-century artwork attributed to Sienese painter Bartolommeo Bulgarini. Art historians suspect the Botticelli depicts a nobleman proudly showing off the earlier artwork. "This image symbolises and exemplifies the Renaissance in Florence," Christopher Apostle, Sotheby's senior vice president, told AFP ahead of the auction. "We haven't seen anything like it in my lifetime," he added, describing it as "a masterpiece."
