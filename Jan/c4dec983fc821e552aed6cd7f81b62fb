67 percent of South Africa's population need to be immunised against COVID-19 by the end of the year - that's government's target. But what exactly is the rollout plan? Officials say the first doses are dedicated to healthcare workers and a priority list has been shared with the public. But how will the jabs reach those it's meant to reach? Masego Rahlaga spoke to one South African who hopes she gets immunised soon.

"But with the age and all my comorbidities, it won't be possible for me to go back. I am diabetic and I am a cancer survivor so I know how it is to be sick and need hospital care".
She's somewhat hopeful the vaccine helps so that she too can don her uniform again and help. READ: COVID-19: Is the vaccine really on its way? "We are so scared out there. You die alone when you are in hospital," Adrianse said. "So, if this vaccine is going to work, give it first to the frontline workers."
In the meantime, Adrianse has to hang up her uniform until she gets immunised before helping again on the frontline. * eNCA's Masego Rahlaga reports.
