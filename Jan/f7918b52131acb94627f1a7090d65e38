JOHANNESBURG - Health Minister Zweli Mkhize remains tight-lipped on where South Africa will be getting its COVID-19 vaccines from. The minister said he could not comment on the question during a visit to Limpopo to check on the province’s response to the spread of the pandemic.

We have given estimations. "The real amount you will only know once you’ve got the vaccine because you don’t know which vaccines you are going to be choosing and how much of that. So, once we know that we will be able to indicate," the minister said.

"Once we are free to announce, we will talk about it. Right now, I can only just tell you that we’ve engaged enough companies to be able to secure a huge number of vaccines to be able to roll out our programme,” he said.
