Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A renowned street artist has been travelling to various locations around the globe with one purpose: To create the largest human chain in the world in a show of togetherness. A pioneer of land art, using biodegradable paint on grass, Saype has now added Cape Town to his list. It’s taken nearly a week for Saype to create what can only be described as graffiti-style artworks in Cape Town. The giant frescos on grass of interlocked hands are part of the artist’s global Beyond Walls project. The artwork has been created using approximately 1,000 litres of biodegradable paint pigments. Saype started his Beyond Walls project in 2019 and has made a point of pushing ahead despite the pandemic. * eNCA's Tanya Nefdt reports. 1. I am very excited that Cape Town is one of the cities chosen to be part of the Beyond Walls initiative. Cape Town is the 9th city, out of 30 to become part of this global artwork.
