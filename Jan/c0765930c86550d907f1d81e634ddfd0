READ: Jan 8 statement: ANC sidesteps Magashule issue "The statement of the NEC will outline some of the resolutions of the conference, specifically the one that talks about how to deal with corruption, issues like stepping aside when you are charged etc," Mashatile said. "I don't think the president will focus on individuals, but will apply to policies, programmes and commit the whole organisation to the implementation of these resolutions. "The Top Six is currently dealing with the issues that were discussed in the previous NEC and coming up with guidelines and the president will deal with principles around those issues."
