The power utility plans to reduce its peak rates in the high-demand season of winter but hike rates in summer, which is the low demand season. Eskom tabled its new electricity tariff structure proposals to the National Energy Regulator of South Africa. READ: COVID-19 negatively impacting Eskom Energy analyst Ted Blom says this doesn’t sound good for households and businesses. "It's very similar to a tariff they tried to push through in 2015, called the peak tariff adjustment," Blom said. "What they're doing is to reduce the winter tariff which is for three months and then they're going to hike the summer tariffs, which are for nine months."
