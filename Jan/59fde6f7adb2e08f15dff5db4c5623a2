The country has been experiencing stage two load-shedding all week. READ: Eskom: Load-shedding here to stay "They don't have any so-called reserve generation capacity and any further loss of supply generation units will result in load-shedding." "As we've seen, we've had Stage 2 load-shedding for several days now, planned to the end of Sunday but the forecast of Eskom has indicated, a high-risk probability of load-shedding, every week for the next three months," energy analyst Chris Yelland said. *Watch the full interview with energy expert Chris Yelland above. The @Eskom_SA three-month forecast on its website shows that the risk of loadshedding is code RED for every week for next 3 months. pic.twitter.com/VB2mcHlHEY
