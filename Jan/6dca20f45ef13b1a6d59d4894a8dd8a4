File: Energy regulator Nersa. JOHANNESBURG - Consumers should brace themselves for an increase in electricity tariffs. Energy regulator Nersa has allowed Eskom to recover an extra R6-billion from consumers after the court ordered Nersa to review previous decisions.

Nersa had originally awarded Eskom a total R32,6-billion for recovery.

Eskom had initially applied for R66-billion. Analysts say Thursday's approval by Nersa means that Eskom could hike tariffs by about two percentage points higher than the 8,5 percent increase due in April.
