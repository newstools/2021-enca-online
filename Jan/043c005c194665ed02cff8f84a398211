ASO / AFP PARIS - French motorcyclist Pierre Cherpin has died from his injuries after a fall during the Dakar Rally, becoming the notoriously perilous race's first fatality this year, organisers said on Friday. Cherpin, 52, died during his medical transfer to France after he crashed at 178 kilometres per hour on Sunday. "During his transfer by medical plane from Jeddah to France, Pierre Cherpin died from the injuries caused by his fall," a statement said. Portuguese rider Paulo Goncalves died last year during the race, which bills itself as the "world's toughest and biggest rally".
