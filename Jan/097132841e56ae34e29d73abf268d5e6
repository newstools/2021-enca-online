Its interim chairperson, Justice Zak Yacoob, has had to recuse himself after a recorded conversation he had with a reporter, surfaced. In it, the judge is using unsavoury language against the journalist. He has since apologised.

Minister Mthethwa said: "Indeed, it was disturbing, distasteful as well. When you listen to it you cannot help but be disappointed generally in how the conversation went and how the journalist was under severe attack. "From there, the judge, even before I reached out to him to interact with him on this matter, he apologised. But I also met him virtually yesterday [Wednesday] and we discussed this matter. He was ready to step down." The minister said the work done by the board should not be tainted by this incident.
