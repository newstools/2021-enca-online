It is a criminal record not to wear the mask. Before, it was us urging you to put the mask on. Now, we take you to the police station. We take you fingerprints. You choose to pay the fine or, you choose to see the magistrate. Both processes give you a criminal record. You know what criminal records do to your life, going forward."
