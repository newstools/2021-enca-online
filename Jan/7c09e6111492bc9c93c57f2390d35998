The Foundation's Board Chairperson Professor Njabulo Ndebele confirmed to eNCA that an independent probe by law firm Bowman Gilfillan is underway after allegations made by a whistleblower last month. Ndebele has refused to get into the details but eNCA understands that the allegations include staff victimisation, nepotism and a general climate of fear. eNCA also saw a leaked internal memo to the Foundation's employees. Ndebele calls for calm and focus in the memo. He also pleads with staff to give the independent investigation a chance.
