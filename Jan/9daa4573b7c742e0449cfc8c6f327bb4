AFP/Michel Comte OTTAWA - Residents of an Ottawa neighbourhood are looking to distance themselves from Donald Trump by renaming their street, which bears his name -- once a source of intrigue, but now an embarrassment. Trump Avenue on the Canadian capital's west side is lined with brick homes, each with two-car garages and kids playing hockey in driveways. The Central Park neighbourhood, known for New York City-themed street names, was built in the late 1990s -- long before a certain Big Apple real estate mogul entered politics. Ottawa city councillor Riley Brockington started gathering support for the name change from people who live on the street this week. Some residents had been petitioning the city for years to change it, but Brockington resisted, saying he feared offending Trump while he was in office. "I was concerned that there might be ramifications againstÂ Canada, that Trump would take punitive measures if word got out that Canada's national capital wanted to take his name off a street sign," Brockington said. "With his exit from the White House, I felt now was a good time to try it." At least 50 percent of residents must agree to the name change to trigger a process that would take several months. Changing the street's name would require new signage, but also new maps and postal addresses for 62 homes. And then there's the matter of selecting a new name. Most other New York names are already taken in Ottawa, and numbered street names such as Fifth Avenue won't do.
