The drama, set in early 1800s London, centres on the well-to-do Bridgerton family as it tries to navigate Regency-era high society in England. "It's designed to be more lavish, sexier and funnier than the standard period drama -- and that's what so surprised and delighted our members," said Netflix vice president of original series, Jinny Howe. Bridgerton is produced by acclaimed American producer Shonda Rhimes and is based on a series of romance novels by Julia Quinn. It has been commissioned for a second series.
