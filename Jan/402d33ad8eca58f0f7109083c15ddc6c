Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - State Capture Inquiry Chairperson, Raymond Zondo, is promising severe action if former President Jacob Zuma, does not appear at the inquiry next week. The commission says Zuma has to obey a court subpoena despite the Constitutional Court reserving judgment on the commission's bid to force him to appear.

A constitutional law expert said Zuma could be playing for time. The commission is due to conclude on 31 March. Advocate Michael Osborne said, "the consequences for the inquiry are fairly dire in the sense that the commissions term ends on 31 March. It seems unlikely then that Mr Zuma then will ever appear simply because the clock is ticking." "The council for the commission has made the point that this precisely is Mr Zuma's intent: to use delaying tactics as much as possible in the hope that before a legal decision can be reached. It will be too late in the sense that the commission closes up shop, as it were, on the 31st of March."
