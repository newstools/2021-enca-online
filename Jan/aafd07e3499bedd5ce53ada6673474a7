She also expressed her disappointment in some hospital staff for withholding the truth over what really happened to her son. "I was so surprised. That a hospital can really be an enemy of truth like this, is shocking. "We are deeply disappointed that these senior staff who are entrusted with providing care for the sick and vulnerable during a pandemic could not find the ethical courage, to tell the truth, and speak out. "How can you deal with human beings if you cannot uphold the truth?" she asked.
