"What we can get in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal is that there is a lot concern that the numbers of people who are infected is still very high and I can say that looking at the numbers here, the positivity rate per day or per week is almost twice as much as what we had and even if the number start reducing it is going to take some time for the provincial health system to feel that there is any reduction," he said. Kwa-Zulu Natal's private and public facilities are feeling the pressure of the alarmingly high rate of infections.
