Weather experts are warning South Africans to brace themselves for heavy rains over the next few days. The tropical system developed off the north-eastern coast of Madagascar. “It will be at this stage that Eloise will require close monitoring as it has potential to make landfall along the southern Mozambican coastline between Beira and Vilanculos during the coming weekend,” the SA Weather Service said. SURVIVAL GUIDE: What to do in a flash flood Professor of Climatology at the Global Change Institute, Francois Engelbrecht, said severe winds and flooding could be possible. "Right now for South Africa, if the storm is going to follow this track into Southern Mozambique and then towards our eastern escarpment in the North East, some parts of our Limpopo province and then southwards along the escarpment in Mpumalanga all the way to Swaziland, these areas [are] getting 100mm of rainfall on Sunday and Monday." Engelbrecht said modelling predicts up to 200mm of rain in certain areas, indicating a high chance of flooding.
