Reed opened with three straight birdies at the 10th, 11th and 12th and added one more at 17 to make the turn at four-under. His four birdies coming in included another three in a row at the fifth, sixth and seventh. "It felt easy out there, just kind of with how I was hitting the driver, getting the ball in the fairway," said Reed, the world number 11 who is coming off a missed cut at La Quinta, California, last week. "I was able to hit the draws, hit the fades. The hardest, longest chance I had was on four today, had a 35-footer for birdie and hit a great first putt, missed it three feet to the right and had a three-footer, but that's about it ... everything else was pretty easy." Noren, a 10-time winner on the European Tour who is still chasing a first US PGA Tour title, also played the North Course, which played much easier than the South Course that will host the US Open in June. Noren -- who fell to Jason Day in a six-hole playoff at Torrey Pines in 2018 -- had an eagle and seven birdies with just one bogey in his eight-under effort. "I hit it very good with my irons and wedges, putted very good," said Noren, who rolled in a 20-foot eagle putt at the 17th. The leading duo were one stroke in front of reigning Rookie of the Year Scottie Scheffler, whose seven-under 65 on the North Course included holing out for an eagle two at the par-four 16th.
