File: South African athlete LuvoÂ Manyonga. JOHANNESBURG - Luvo Manyonga has had another run in with the Athletics Integrity Unit and could face a two-year ban. The South Africa Olympic Silver medallist has been provisionally suspended for anti-doping whereabouts failures. Manyonga was issued with the notice of charge and could be banned for up to two years if found guilty. That could rule him out of the Olympic Games which are scheduled to start in Tokyo on July 23. The AIU lay a Whereabouts Failure charge against an athlete that fails to submit their location ahead of time for random out-of-competition drug tests. That also applies to athletes, who fail to appear at a pre-arranged time for a test three times in a 12-month period.
