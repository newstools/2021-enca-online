The pandemic means a limited number of people, including the judiciary and the president, will be in the National Assembly chamber in two weeks’ time. President Cyril Ramaphosa will be addressing the nation on 11 February without the traditional pomp and ceremony that signals the official start of the parliamentary year. WATCH: Ramaphosa delivers Sona 2020 Parliament’s presiding officers say they are mindful of the seriousness of the coronavirus and its impact on society. But the event is too important to be cancelled. "We cannot have rules that affect society that do not affect ourselves," said Thandi Modise, National Assembly speaker. WATCH: Modise warns Sona disruptors "So it’s us going through everything society is going through, but also us seeing the need not to forego SONA because it is important to mark the beginning of each financial year, to outline what the head of state has in mind as the executive for the country. " Despite opting for a hybrid session of both houses of Parliament, the speaker says errant behaviour won’t be tolerated. “We’ve had many hybrid and joint meetings of both houses, in fact two joint sittings, and the rules have been applied," she said. "Applied equally, applied without fear or favour, and that’s what we intend to do. We think our rules are adequate.” * eNCA's Lindsay Dentlinger reports.
