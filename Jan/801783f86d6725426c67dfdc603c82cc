Courtesy of #DStv403 DURBAN - There is growing concern about KwaZulu-Natal's COVID-19 infection rate as the province has almost 93,000 active cases. The National Institute for Communicable Diseases said it's becoming more difficult to deal with the virus there but the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department insists that lack of beds is a private hospital matter. READ: Govt investigating shocking video filmed at KZN hospital Dr Sandile Tshabalala, the KZN Health Department HoD says that public health services have adequate space and resources to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. He encouraged patients to be moved to where there is space.
Dr Tshabalala said, "that is happening in the private sector, I have checked it. I have not had it happening in the public sector." "I have said and the MEC has said: if a person can't find a bed in one institution let that person be taken to another hospital within the public sector." "What we've also experienced is when a person in the private sector calls us and wants a bed and when they don't get a bed they choose to go and find somewhere else. With us our ambulance service knows if there's no bed in hospital A there will be a bed in hospital B so there is no way that patients will be moving around simply because there are beds."
