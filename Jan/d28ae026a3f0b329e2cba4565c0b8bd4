The Mdzananda Animal Clinic said the number of abandoned pets has skyrocketed after the festive season. READ: Khayelitsha clinic struggling to cope with influx of abandoned pets Fundraising and Communications Manager, Marcelle du Plessis, said it is normal to see an increase in pet abandonment during the festive season when people travel to visit family for extended periods. Du Plessis said with more people losing employment during the COVID-19 pandemic, there are also more families unable to care for their animals. She said it is encouraging that people are seeking help but the clinic's small rehoming program is overwhelmed and is appealing to families to offer their assistance as foster homes or for adoption.
