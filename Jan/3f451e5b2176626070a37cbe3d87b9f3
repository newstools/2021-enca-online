AFP/Wang Zhao BEIJING - Temperatures in Beijing were set to plummet to a three-decade low overnight on Wednesday, but that didn't stop a hardy group of retirees plunging into icy waters to indulge in their bracing hobby of outdoor swimming. As the mercury fell to -11 Celsius (-12 Fahrenheit) in China's capital by the afternoon -- and was forecast to dip as low as -18 overnight -- around 15 swimmers jumped into icy outdoor waters at a central city park. "It's cold in the water, but you will feel good when you come out," promises 60-year-old Nie Bing, emerging from the cold waves in a pair of trunks. Wearing swimsuits, goggles, hats, water shoes and socks and even gloves, the band of swimmers take to the water every day for a dip, whatever the weather. In midwinter, they often have to break the ice that forms over the lake, sweeping sheets of it to one side with a fishing rod to create swimming lanes. Nearby, less hardy souls, bundled up in layers against the chill, glide across the frozen lake on their ice skates. "The colder it is, the more you want to swim," affirmed another swimmer surnamed Zhang, in his 70s. China's meteorological authority has issued a severe weather warning across large parts of the country, saying it will be hit by drastic temperature drops and strong gales.
