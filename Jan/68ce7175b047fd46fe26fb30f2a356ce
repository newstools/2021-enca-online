READ: Over 40m South Africans targeted for vaccine Nathaniel Mabelebele, National Chairperson of Denosa's student movement, said on Monday, healthcare authorities are going back on their promises for secure employment for nurses.
Mabelebele said, "the actual fact here is <around> the absorbtion of community service nurses, the nurses who started their community services the previous year with the hope of continuing employment because when they signed their contracts in <their> first year." "They were assured they would have to work in the same province for the number of years they were funded for, which is four years, that is accompanying the one year compulsory community service." "Now, after the one year of community service they are told their contracts are being terminated they have no employment so they must try to join agencies and look for a job elsewhere," he said. Nurses have also said they were told they were no longer employed without sufficient notice. Mabelebele said the government has promised they will absorb the community service nurses into the healthcare system and is expecting communication to that effect within five days of the protest.
