AFP/Alexander Joe JOHANNESBURG - Kaizer Chiefs' season has gone from bad to worse after they suffered their fourth defeat of the season, leaving them one place away from the relegation zone. Facing their former coach Ernst Middendorp, with whom they lost the league title on the final day during the 2019/2020 campaign, Amakhosi were hopeful of getting one over the German. However Judas Moseamedi tormented the hosts, netting twice, to help Maritzburg leapfrog Chiefs to 12th spot in the standings. Amakhosi are now in 14th position in the league.
