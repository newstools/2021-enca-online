The SpaceX Falcon9 lifted a record-breaking number of satellites in a single payload when its Transporter-1 ride-share mission blasted off from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Sunday. AFP/SpaceX MIAMI - SpaceX on Sunday launched its Falcon 9 rocket carrying a record number of satellites on board, the private space company said. The rocket successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida at 10am, 24 hours after its initial take-off had been scrubbed due to bad weather. Andy Tran, a SpaceX production supervisor, said in a video of the launch that the Falcon 9 was carrying 133 commercial and government "spacecraft" as well 10 SpaceX satellites.

SpaceX is flying Falcon 9 under a "rideshare" programme through which other firms and governments pay the Elon Musk-founded company to deliver their technologies to space. Minutes after taking off, the Falcon 9's main booster that had thrust the rocket to the edge of space separated from the rest of the craft and dropped back down to Earth in a controlled fall.

In a series of tweets, SpaceX said all 143 satellites had been successfully deployed. SpaceX aims to send thousands of small satellites into space to form a global broadband system called Starlink. Scientists have expressed concerns about the number of objects clogging the space around Earth. SpaceX says their satellites are designed to burn up in the atmosphere within a few years.
