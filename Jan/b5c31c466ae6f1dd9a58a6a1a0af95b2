Solidarity's Anton van der Bijl said: "We don't foresee that she will withdraw that directive. "Unfortunately, we will then have to proceed to the court if the directive is not withdrawn. We will have no other alternative but to court and then we will ask for a court order against the minister in her personal capacity."
