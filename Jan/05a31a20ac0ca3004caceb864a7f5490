Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - More families are breaking their silence about ill-treatment at the Tembisa Hospital in Gauteng. Under the banner Justice for Shoni, they’ve joined Shonisani Lethole’s family in calling for the suspension of the facility’s CEO. Lethole died at the hospital last June. The Health Ombudsman released a report into the circumstances surrounding his death.

Sevey Ncube's family say she wasn’t offered food for four days and that they weren’t alerted about her death until they went to the hospital to inquire. She was admitted at the hospital last June, around the same time as Lethole. Her daughter has also spoken about the impact her mother’s death has had.

"The seven months that my mother has not been around have been hard," said Nicole Ncube. "I had to go live with a friend since I cannot afford to pay rent. "This is while the doctors carry on with their lives”. * eNCA's Masego Rahlaga reports.
