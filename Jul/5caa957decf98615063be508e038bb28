Spectators will be barred from most venues and athletes must be tested daily.Â AFP/Kazuhiro Nogi TOKYO - Tokyo entered the final Olympic countdown on Friday, but there was little fanfare with just one week until the opening ceremony, as virus infections surge in the Japanese capital. Organisers have been forced to bar spectators from all events in the city and most venues hosting competitions elsewhere in the country. And Olympic participants from athletes to media face a range of anti-virus measures including regular testing and limits on their movement. But with Tokyo recording its highest case numbers since a winter wave in January, scrutiny of virus risks around the Games is intense. The government has asked organisers to investigate reports of Olympic participants breaking virus rules "and impose strict punishment" if necessary, government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told reporters. On Thursday, International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach insisted anti-virus rules were "in place, and they are working, and they are enforced." Among thousands of Games-related arrivals to the country in July, only a handful of positive cases have been recorded.
