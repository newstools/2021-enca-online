The British and Irish Lions’ Series match against the Bulls on Saturday has been postponed and the Springboks’ second Test against Georgia is in doubt. This comes after four more Springbok players and six management staff -- including coach Jacques Nienaber -- tested positive for COVID-19. The players who returned positive tests are Marvin Orie, Frans Steyn, Handre Pollard and Frans Malherbe. The odds seem heavily stacked against the game proceeding after four Georgian players also tested positive for the virus. SA Rugby said the match was being reviewed. The Bulls game is being postponed with a view to rescheduling it or to accommodate an alternative opponent. As it stands, the British and Irish Lions match against the Cell C Sharks will still go ahead as planned.
