AFP/BC Wildfire Service OTTAWA - The Canadian military was on standby to help evacuate towns and fight more than 170 wildfires fueled by a record-smashing heat wave and tinder-dry conditions as the government in Ottawa warned of a "long and challenging summer" ahead. At least 174 fires were active in the western province of British Columbia, 78 of them sparked in the last two days, officials said. Most were caused by intense lightning storms. "We saw 12,000 lightning strikes, roughly," said Cliff Chapman, the director of provincial operations for British Columbia Wildfire Service, according to public broadcaster the CBC. "Many of those lightning strikes were hitting near communities, (as) was seen in the Kamloops area." While the immediate blame for the scorching heat has been placed on a high-pressure "heat dome" trapping warm air in the region, climate change is making record-setting temperatures more frequent. "The dry conditions and the extreme heat in British Columbia are unprecedented," Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said. "These wildfires show that we are in the earliest stages of what promises to be a long and challenging summer." Roughly 1,000 people have fled the wildfires in British Columbia, with many others still missing. The British Columbia medical examiner's office said there had been 719 deaths in the past week, "three times more" than the average number recorded over the period.
