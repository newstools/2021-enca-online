Two people have been confirmed dead after the disaster at the hot-spring resort of Atami in central Japan, with 10 people rescued and around 20 still missing, a local government official said. Torrents of mud crashed through part of the town on Saturday morning following days of heavy rain, sweeping away hillside homes and turning residential areas into a quagmire that stretched down to the nearby coast. "We resumed rescue operations early in the morning with some 1,000 rescuers, including 140 troops," a Shizuoka prefecture official told AFP. Rescue operations resumed on Sunday with 1,000 workers, an official said "We are trying our best to search for survivors as quickly as possible while carrying out the operation very carefully as it is still raining." Around 2,800 homes in Atami have been left without power, the Tokyo Electric Power Company said on Saturday. The town, around 90 kilometres southwest of Tokyo, saw rainfall of 313 millimetres in just 48 hours to Saturday -- higher than the average monthly total for July of 242.5 millimetres, according to public broadcaster NHK. Much of Japan is currently in its annual rainy season, which lasts several weeks and often causes floods and landslides, prompting local authorities to issue evacuation orders.
