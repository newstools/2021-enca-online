No one in South Africa is above the law, that seems to be the consensus after the late night arrest of former president Jacob Zuma for contempt of court. He has now begun a 15-month prison term in Estcourt. To discuss this further, Sally Burdett speaks to Professor Judith February, lawyer, political analyst and a member of the Defend our Democracy campaign. Courtesy #DStv403 ESTCOURT - Former President Jacob Zuma on Thursday began a 15-month sentence for contempt. Here are some facts about the town, the jail and the prison regimen. - Located around 180 kilometresÂ northwest of Durban, Estcourt was given its name in 1863 in honour of Thomas Estcourt, a British parliamentarian who sponsored settlers to migrate there. - The town is best known for its bacon factory, one of the oldest in South Africa and home to a popular brand of bacon and spare ribs, Eskort. WATCH: South Africans react to Zuma's arrest - The Estcourt Correctional Centre is a medium-security prison that houses both youth and adult prisoners. Built in 1966, it was fully refurbished and re-opened in 2019 with state-of-the-art facilities. - The prison has a capacity to hold 512 inmates and a training centre to provide offenders with marketable skills for after their release. Prisoners have access to television and use of public phones. Mobile phones are prohibited. - The authorities insist Zuma will not be given any favourable treatment. He underwent standard medical checks and will spend the next 14 days in isolation in line with COVID-19 regulations, Justice Minister Ronald Lamola said.
