India batsman Suryakumar Yadav shrugged off complaints that only a weakened side had been sent to Sri Lanka COLOMBO - India batsman Suryakumar Yadav on Wednesday shrugged off complaints that only a weakened side had been sent to Sri Lanka for a limited overs tour. Former Sri Lanka captain Arjuna Ranatunga slammed the island's sports leaders for agreeing to the tour by a "B Team" Indian side without top stars Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Mohammed Shami, Jasprit Bumrah and Rishabh Pant. The team led by opening batsman Shikhar Dhawan will play three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 matches starting July 13.

Yadav is among a host of players in Sri Lanka looking to impress selectors before the Twenty20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates in October-November. "It's a great opportunity for everyone having a tour amid this situation," said Yadav, who plays for five-time champions Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. "It's a great challenge and responsibility for each and every one to come out here and express themselves," he added. "I am excited and looking forward to it."
