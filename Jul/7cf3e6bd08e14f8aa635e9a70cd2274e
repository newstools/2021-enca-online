That's the argument from Advocate Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, who has appeared before the High Court in Pietermaritzburg on Tuesday, on behalf of the State Capture Inquiry. WATCH | Zuma back in court Zuma has approached the court to prevent his 15-month prison term from being enforced. This is pending the hearing and decision of his rescission application in the Constitutional Court. "There is no clarity that is required from the Constitutional Court, the order is manifest, all it needs to be done is to be enforced," he said. "Unless the police themselves obtain an order stopping themselves from executing but at this point in time we cannot be too critical of the police because their deadline lapses tomorrow so the order remains operative."
