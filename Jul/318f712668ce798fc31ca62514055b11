Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Former public protector Thuli Madonsela says politicians worldwide are known to politicise their court trials but the former public protector has cautioned President Cyril Ramaphosa against getting involved in the Zuma legal saga. READ:Â Lawyer 'shocked' by Zuma's ConCourt judgment Madonsela said, "President Zuma has politicised his trials from day one and that cannot be stopped. But, the moment President Ramaphosa gets involved in this case, that would be unconstitutional and a violation of separation of power, he has done well in staying out of this trial." "ConCourt also had something about public opinion and it's been criticised for that. I think the court was saying in so doing, paraphrasing <Nelson> Mandela during the inauguration, that the concourt should not worry too much about politics." "How many politicians that are powerful in this country and can mobilise a whole lot of people to come and support them, many drug lords also do the same. Should the concourt therefore not implement justice because it's afraid of the politics, then what kind of a country would prevail in those circumstances."
