The augmented reality glasses can provide information on objects. AFP/Josep Lago MADRID -When their two-year-old son Biel started falling over a lot and had difficulty climbing stairs after learning to walk, Jaume Puig and his wife sought medical help to figure out the problem. After visiting several doctors, the toddler was diagnosed with low vision, a condition far more common than blindness that makes daily tasks a challenge. In Biel's case, it was due to an optic nerve problem but the condition can also be caused by defects in the retina, brain or other parts of the visual system, or by conditions such as glaucoma or macular degeneration. Low vision can't be corrected with glasses or surgery. And while magnifiers can help with specific tasks like reading, there was no available technology to help the toddler get around. So in 2017, Puig, a Spanish electrical engineer, and his wife Constanza Lucero, a doctor, founded Biel Glasses, a company that created a digital device to help those with low vision to move about safely on their own. A man uses Biel digital glasses that help people with limited sight better perceive their surroundings A cross between gaming goggles and glasses, it creates a 3D image onto which text, graphics and video can be overlaid upon real-world images. It also uses AI to detect and signal obstacles. "We thought we could use these technologies to take advantage of the vision he does have so he can be more independent. "Maybe we can't cure him but we can help him," said Puig of his son who is now eight. When a wearer approaches an object blocking their path, a large red circle will appear on the screen warning them of the obstacle. It also allows them to zoom in on a street sign or other object.
