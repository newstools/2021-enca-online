Novak Djokovic kisses the winner's trophy after beating Italy's Matteo Berrettini in the Wimbledon final. AFP/Pool PARIS - World number one Novak Djokovic said Thursday he will play at the Tokyo Olympics, paving the way for the first Golden Grand Slam by a male player. "I booked my flight for Tokyo and will proudly be joining #TeamSerbia for the Olympics," tweeted Djokovic in English. "With much pride I'm packing for Tokyo and joining our national team in the fight for the brightest medals at the Olympic arenas," he then tweeted in Serbian. "For me playing for Serbia was always a special joy and motivation and I will give my best to make us all happy. Let's go." The 34-year-old has already won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon titles this year. He needs Olympic gold and then the US Open to become the first man to sweep the Golden Grand Slam. The Golden Slam has only ever been achieved once in the women's game when Steffi Graf swept the board in 1988. Djokovic's path to potential gold in Tokyo had already been eased by the decision of rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal to skip the tournament. US Open champion Dominic Thiem is also an absentee. Djokovic won a bronze medal in singles at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing where he was defeated by Nadal in the semi-finals before beating James Blake of the United States for third place. At London in 2012, he carried Serbia's flag at the opening ceremony but was again a semi-final loser at the hands of Andy Murray. He was defeated by Juan Martin del Potro in the bronze medal match. Del Potro also beat him in the first round in Rio four years later.
