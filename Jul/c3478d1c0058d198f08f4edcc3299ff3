They have asked the Constitutional Court to issue a directive barring the police from arresting Zuma pending the judgment on Friday. That is when the KwaZulu-Natal High Court in Pietermaritzburg will respond to his bid to stay his arrest. READ: WATCH: Zuma's arrest imminent? The Constitutional Court has sentenced him to 15-months in jail for contempt of court. This for failing to appear before the state capture inquiry. The court also ordered the police to arrest the former head of state should he fail to present himself to a police station within five calendar days of the judgment.
