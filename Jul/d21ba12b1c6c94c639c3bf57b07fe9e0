South Africa's Louis Oosthuizen stormed into the lead during the first round of the British Open on Thursday.Â AFP/Paul Ellis SANDWICH - The long-awaited return of the British Open got under way under blue skies at Royal St. George's on Thursday as former champion Louis Oosthuizen shot to the top of the leaderboard on six under par. England's Richard Bland fired the first shot of the 149th Open Championship, which was delayed a year by the cancellation of the 2020 edition due to the coronavirus pandemic. Oosthuizen has been frustrated so far this year in his attempt to add to his only major triumph after cruising to victory in the 2010 British Open at St Andrews. The South African finished second in this year's last two majors, the US PGA Championship and US Open, and is now in contention again. After starting with seven straight pars, Oosthuizen accelerated around the turn with seven birdies in 10 holes. Jordan Spieth, who lifted the Claret Jug at Royal Birkdale in 2017, is one shot back after setting the clubhouse lead with a 65. The American refound his form with victory at the Texas Open in April, his first for nearly four years. Canada's Mackenzie Hughes, on his British Open debut, and American Brian Harman are two shots off the lead. Pre-tournament favourite Jon Rahm, this year's US Open champion, was stung by a double bogey at the par four ninth to be two over through 16 holes.
