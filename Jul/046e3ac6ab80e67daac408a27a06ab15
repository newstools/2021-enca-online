Novak Djokovic celebrates winning against Italy's Matteo Berrettini.Â AFP/Glyn Kirk LONDON - Novak Djokovic won a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title and sixth Wimbledon on Sunday with a four-set victory over Italian slugger Matteo Berrettini with rival superstar Roger Federer hailing the achievement as a "wonderful performance". The world number one triumphed 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3 to move level on 20 majors with Federer and Rafael Nadal. His win also put him three-quarters of the way to the first calendar Grand Slam of all four majors since 1969. "I could definitely envisage that happening and I hope I will give it a shot. I'm in great form and played well and having my best form at Grand Slams is my number one priority," said Djokovic. A sixth victory at the All England Club for Djokovic, who was playing in his 30th final at the Slams, added to his nine Australian Opens, two Roland Garros titles as well as three at the US Open. Should he win a fourth title in New York in September, he will become just the third man in history after Don Budge (1938) and Rod Laver (1962 and 1969) to complete the calendar Grand Slam. "It was more than a battle. He is a true Italian hammer I felt it on my skin," said Djokovic of Berrettini. Of sharing the record with Federer and Nadal, he said: "It means none of us three will stop. Roger and Rafa are legends, they are the reason I am where I am today. "They showed me what I needed to do to get stronger, physically, tactically and mentally. Over the last 10 years it has been an incredible journey that's not stopping here." Djokovic also now has 85 career titles while he has become the first man to break the $150-million prize money barrier. A gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics could give him the first-ever Golden Grand Slam by a male player.
