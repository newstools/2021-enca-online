Britney Spears told the court that she had been prevented from having a contraceptive implant removed, despite wanting more children. AFP/Frederic J. Brown LOS ANGELES - Three weeks after Britney Spears sensationally called for an end to her "abusive" guardianship, the pop singer's legal battle returns to court in Los Angeles. Spears gave explosive testimony on June 23 in which she pleaded with a California judge to allow her to end the conservatorship long controlled by her father, and to choose her own lawyer. Her 20-minute emotional and almost breathless monologue ramped up worldwide interest in a case that was already the subject of a frenzied #FreeBritney campaign by her adoring fans, who are expected outside court again Wednesday.

Since her testimony last month, many of the central figures in the complex and controversial network installed to manage Spears' affairs have distanced themselves. Her impassioned testimony has drawn widespread support, from fans chanting outside the courtroom to her musical peers Christina Aguilera and Madonna.

She said she had been made to perform shows under threat of lawsuit, and that she was not even allowed to get changed in privacy or drive her own car. "I just want my life back. It's been 13 years and it's enough," said Spears.
