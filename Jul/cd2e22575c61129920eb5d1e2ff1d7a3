Chris Gayle passed 14,000 runs in all T20 matches during his innings against Australia.Â AFP/Randy Brooks ST LUCIA - A Chris Gayle half-century blasted the West Indies to victory over Australia in St Lucia on Monday, clinching the five-match T20 series between the sides. Chasing a modest target of 142, Gayle recaptured his most destructive form in racing to 67 off only 38 balls to take his team to the target with five overs to spare at the Daren Sammy Stadium. By spearheading the West Indies to an insurmountable 3-0 lead in the series, the 41-year-old also sent an ominous warning that he could yet be a factor in the Caribbean side's defence of the World T20 title later this year. Gayle's pyrotechnics followed another efficient West Indies performance in the field as wrist-spinner Hayden Walsh again presented the most effective challenge to the Australians with figures of two for 18 in limiting the visitors to 141 for six. All-rounder Moises Henriques topscored with 33 and struck the only two sixes of his team's innings. Henriques' contribution followed his side's best opening partnership of the series -- 41 -- between captain Aaron Finch and Matthew Wade. However, the tempo of the innings dropped considerably when they were separated by Obed McCoy in what proved to be the seamer's only over of the innings. Gayle passed 14,000 runs in all T20 matches during the innings, the only player to so far reach that milestone. For Finch, it was another case of his team failing to meet the expected standards. "We really should have built on that start but I didn't help the situation when I got out and when you're playing a team like this with so much experience and so many world-class players it is always going to be tough," he explained. "Yes, we are missing a number of key players here but that is no excuse. We expect better of ourselves and haven't managed that yet so far in this series."
