A member of the Botswana cabinet holds the 1,174-carat diamond in Gaborone. AFP/Monirul Bhuiyan GABORONE - An exceptionally large and white 1,174-carat diamond stone has been unearthed in Botswana, a mining company announced Wednesday, trumping another huge precious stone found in the country last month. The latest find, which fills the palm of a man's hand, was discovered on June 12 by Canadian Diamond firm, Lucara and presented to the country's cabinet in the capital Gaborone on Wednesday. "This is history in the making, for us and Botswana as well," said the company's managing director Naseem Lahri, adding that the diamond sits in third position among the world's largest gemstones.

Last month, Botswanan diamond firm Debswana said it had recovered the "third largest" stone in the world at 1,098-carats on June 1. The latest find solidifies Botswana as a leader on the world stage of the largest stones, accounting for six in the top ten list.
