AFP/Robyn Beck LOS ANGELES - An emotional Britney Spears scored a victory in her bid to end her father's control of her affairs as a judge ruled she could appoint her own lawyer to help end a guardianship that the pop superstar slammed as "cruelty." Spears phoned back into a Los Angeles court, three weeks after her first explosive testimony in which she pleaded with a judge to free her from the years-long conservatorship ramped up worldwide interest in the case. During Wednesday's hearing, Judge Brenda Penny accepted the resignation of Spears' previous attorney and signalled she would accept the 39-year-old's new choice, Mathew Rosengart, to represent her.

"We will be filing a petition as soon as possible to move Mr Spears, subject to our formal retention," said Rosengart, a former federal prosecutor who has represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn. "Why is Mr Spears not voluntarily stepping down?" Rosengart asked. "He does not belong in this conservatorship anymore. And we believe he should voluntarily step down immediately."

"I'm angry and I will go there," the singer said, even telling the court at one point she thought "they were trying to kill me." "If the court doesn't see this as abuse... I don't know what is," said Spears, calling for "investigations" and a restraining order against her father.
