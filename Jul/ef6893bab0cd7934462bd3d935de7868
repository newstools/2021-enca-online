Rani's owners say Guinness World Records will decide in three months if she is a record-breaker. AFP/Munir Uz zaman CHARIGRAM - Thousands of people are defying a nationwide coronavirus lockdown in Bangladesh to see Rani, a 51cm tall cow whose owners claim it is the world's smallest. The 23-month-old dwarf cow has become a media star with scores of newspapers and television stations throwing the spotlight on the tiny bovine at a farm near Dhaka. Pictures of Rani on social media platforms have set off a tourist frenzy. Despite a nationwide transport shutdown because of record coronavirus infections and deaths, people are flocking in rickshaws to the farm in Charigram. People have flocked to a farm outside Dhaka to see what its owners say is the world's smallest cow Rani is 66cm long and weighs only 26kg, but the owners say it is 10 centimetres shorter than the smallest cow in Guinness World Records. M.A. Hasan Howlader, manager of Shikor Agro farm, used a tape measure to show dozens of onlookers how Rani dwarfs her closest rival Manikyam, a cow in the Indian state Kerala that currently holds the world record. "People come long distances despite the coronavirus lockdown. Most want to take selfies with Rani," Howlader told AFP, adding Guinness World Records had promised a decision in three months. Rani is a Bhutti, or Bhutanese, cow which is prized for its meat in Bangladesh. The other Bhuttis on the farm are twice Rani's size.
