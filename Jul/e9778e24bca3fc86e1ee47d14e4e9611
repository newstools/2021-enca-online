Correctional Services spokesperson Singabakho Nxumalo said as per regulations due to COVID-19, Zuma had to go to the isolation section all newly-admitted inmates are kept. READ: Zuma spends first night in custody "He will be there for about 14 days up until he is cleared. But that has also given us an opportunity for other processes to continue which involves the assessment for healthcare, mental state, vulnerability, suicide risks and that will take some days," Nxumalo said. "The outcomes of that assessment will then determine a suitable facility to house him because he has to be classified, is he medium-risk or low-risk, is he having vulnerabilities? Where can we best take care of those vulnerabilities? Is it healthcare or otherwise?

The ANC is meanwhile calling for calm from its members and to respect the decision taken by Zuma to abide by the rulings of the court.
