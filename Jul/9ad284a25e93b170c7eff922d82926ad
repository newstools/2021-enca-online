The hearings are aimed at addressing the lack of transformation in the sport. WATCH:  CSA hearings into transformation Researcher Dr Mary-Ann Dove addressed the misconceptions that quotas have created amongst players. Her findings show that targets have not parachuted more black players into local cricket, as perceived by some in the game. WATCH: Lawson Naidoo outlines targets for CSA Former Sports Minister Ngconde Balfour conceded that while efforts were made to address transformation during his tenure between 1999 and 2004, perhaps not enough had been done. Free State cricket's Zola Thamae gave insight into the state of the women's games, with an apparent lack of interest from administrators to change the status quo. The hearings are being chaired by CSA Transformation Ombud Dumisa Ntsebeza.
