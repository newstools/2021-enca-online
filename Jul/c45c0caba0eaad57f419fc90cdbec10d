Scenes like this will soon be a thing of the past in Venice. AFP/Miguel Medina ROME - Large cruise ships will be banned from sailing into the centre of Venice from August 1, Italy announced after years of warnings they risk causing irreparable damage to the lagoon city. The decision comes just days before a meeting of the UN's cultural organisation UNESCO, which had proposed to add Venice to its list of endangered heritage sites. "The decree adopted today represents an important step for the protection of the Venetian lagoon system," Prime Minister Mario Draghi said after the decree was approved at a cabinet meeting.

The move will see the biggest ships diverted to the city's industrial port of Marghera. However, this is viewed as only a temporary solution, with ministers calling for ideas on a new permanent terminal. The passengers aboard cruise ships provide a huge economic boost to Venice, but many residents say the giant floating hotels should not sail past the iconic St Mark's Square.

The debate was reignited by the return last month of cruises after the coronavirus pandemic, when the throngs of tourists that normally fill the streets stayed away. Venice was put on UNESCO's heritage list in 1987 as an "extraordinary architectural masterpiece", but the body warned last month of the need for a "more sustainable tourism management". After years of debate, Italian Culture Minister Dario Franceschini said the government had decided to act now "to avoid the real risk of the city's inclusion on the endangered world heritage list".
