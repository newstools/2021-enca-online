South African Police Services (SAPS) members arrest looters at the Lotsoho Mall in Katlehong township, east of Johannesburg, on July 12, 2021. Several shops are damaged and cars burnt in Johannesburg, following a night of violence. Police are on the scene trying to control further protests. It is unclear if this is linked to sporadic protests following the incarceration of former president Jacob Zuma. JOHANNESBURG - President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation on persistent public violence. The exact time of the address is still to be announced.
