"He will obviously be classified as a minimum security risk because there is no seriousness of the offence and he is a first-time offender.” READ: Zuma fights prison sentence But he almost certainly won’t be kept among the general prison population. Fitz believes Zuma will be kept in an isolated part of the prison to remove him from other offenders, but guards too.  VIZ@ GUARDS * eNCA’s Barry Bateman reports.
