Scarlett Johansson stars as the 'Black Widow,' a Disney/Marvel film that set a Covid-era record in its opening weekend. AFP/Valerie Macon LOS ANGELES - New Disney superhero film "Black Widow" took in an estimated $80-million in North America this three-day weekend, a pandemic-era record as the Marvel Universe showed continuing lure, industry watcher Exhibitor Relations reported. The movie, starring Scarlett Johansson as the cat-suited superspy, took in an additional $60-million streaming on Disney Plus (at $29.99 for subscribers), and $78-million internationally, for an impressive global total of $218-million. Hollywood Reporter called it "unprecedented" for a studio to announce its streaming total on a film's opening weekend. The film has yet to open in China. Far behind in second place was Universal's action thriller "F9: The Fast Saga," at $10.9-million, down by more than half from last weekend's take. It had held the previous pandemic-era record with a $70-million opening. Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and John Cena star in this ninth installment in the "Fast and Furious" franchise. Universal also claimed the next two box-office spots. In third was its animated sequel "The Boss Baby: Family Business," at $8.7-million. The yarn about a cannily can-do "boss baby" features the voices of Alec Baldwin, Eva Longoria, Jeff Goldblum and Lisa Kudrow. Horror film "The Forever Purge" placed fourth, at $6.7-million. This latest in the "Purge" series is again set in a dystopian near-future where all crime, even murder, is made legal one day a year. Ana de la Reguera and Tenoch Huerta star. And in fifth was Paramount's "A Quiet Place: Part II," at $3-million, pushing its domestic total near $150-million in its seventh week. John Krasinski directed the horror flic; his wife Emily Blunt stars.
