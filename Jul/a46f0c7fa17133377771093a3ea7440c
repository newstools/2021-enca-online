The qualified doctors are waiting for the National Health Department to allocate them hospitals at which to serve their mandatory two-year internships.

Many have been unemployed since March and if the department fails to find them jobs soon, they could face legal action. * etv News and Sports reporter Rianté Padayachee reports.
