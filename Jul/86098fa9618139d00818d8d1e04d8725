That's the view of Reverend Frank Chikane. However, Chikane says pardons are difficult in their nature and more complicated if it is political. READ: Zuma spends first night in custody "The former president [Zuma] assisted a lot by handing himself over to the authorities. I think that the standoff was not helping the country at all. "It has avoided any risks that were anticipated so we really thank him for taking that position and making that decision," Chikane said. "On the issue about [the] pardon: Let me say what I said because the words can be problematic. READ: Foundation maintains Zuma is innocent "I was asked whether I would consider a pardon if he asked for it and my view is: Pardons are a prerogative of the president there are rules that govern pardons, you can't just do it ordinarily," he said. "I said that but people who apply for pardons, in my view, would be those who say, "I made a mistake. I shouldn't have done this" or "this has happened. I'm asking for a pardon". "It can't be that those you are defying the courts and then ask for pardon."
