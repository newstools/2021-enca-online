File: US jobs numbers were welcomed by the market.Â AFP/Frederic J. Brown NEW YORK - Wall Street stocks surged to fresh records while the dollar retreated after a solid US jobs report that was not seen as accelerating a monetary policy shift. After a muted session in Europe, the three major US indices notched all-time highs after the Labor Department reported the US economy added 850,000 jobs in June, better than expected and far stronger than in the prior two months. Analysts however said the much-anticipated monthly data was not uniformly outstanding, noting that unemployment ticked up to 5.9 percent. The market viewed the data as a "Goldilocks"-type outcome in reference to the fairy tale character, who famously preferred her porridge at the right temperature, not too hot or too cold. Briefing.com analyst Patrick O'Hare characterised the data as "okay." The report "tabled any kind of concern that the report would stir the Fed to action faster than expected," he told AFP in an interview. Most large tech firms enjoyed another banner session, with Apple and Microsoft piling on two percent or more, along with Amazon, where founder Jeff Bezos is set to step down as CEO next week, but maintain a leadership position as chairman. But IBM shares fell 4.6, weighing on the Dow, as it announced that Jim Whitehurst would step down as president of the tech giant following the integration of Red Hat, which Whitehurst had led prior to its acquisition by IBM.
