His latest album, "After Hours," released in March 2020, was illustrated by concept videos loaded with references to well-known feature films, such as "After Hours" or "Chinatown." He has often been reported to have a passion for cinema, to the point of agreeing to play himself in the Safdie brothers' low-budget film "Uncut Gems" (2019), to critical acclaim. Taken from "After Hours," the track "Blinding Lights" was the most listened to song on Spotify in 2020. The track spent 43 weeks in the top five for sales in the United States, shattering the previous record of 27 weeks held by the Chainsmokers and Ed Sheeran.
