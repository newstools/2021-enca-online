Someone to look up to: a mural of Lionel Messi looms over the playground of his former school ROSARIO, Argentina - "From another galaxy... and from my neighborhood," declares a freshly painted mural of Lionel Messi in the Argentinian town where he was born 34 years ago. The mural covers one end of a four-story apartment building in the La Bajada neighborhood of Rosario where the star lived as a child, and faces the primary school he attended. "We thought of Leo and the admiration we have for him and we thought that there is nothing big enough to express that in Rosario," Marlen Zuriaga, one of the muralists, told AFP. The 14-meter-high, 8-meter-wide artwork unveiled on Thursday depicts a bearded, shirtless Messi, and the smaller figure of the player as a child juggling a ball.
