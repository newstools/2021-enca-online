Munoz, who claimed his lone PGA Tour title in 2019, saw the putts dropping late to make the most of a solid day at Deere Run in Silvis, Illinois, where he was tied atop the leaderboard with American Chesson Hadley on eight-under par 63. "Hit the ball really good all day," said Munoz, who had nine birdies overall. "I got hot with the putter coming in. I wasn't making a lot on the front nine, so it was nice to see them go in on the back." Hadley had eight birdies without a bogey. The leading duo were one stroke in front of Colombia's Camilo Villegas and Americans Chez Reavie and Hank Lebioda. Villegas and Reavie set the early pace with bogey-free 64s. Lebioda was tied for the lead at eight-under through 17 holes but bogeyed his final hole, the ninth, to fall one back. Munoz was two-under on the front nine after three birdies and a three-putt bogey at the eighth. After a birdie at 11 he well and truly caught fire with a birdie at 14. After two more birdies he was in the left rough at the 17th and had to chip out. "Then it was kind of like a tricky shot, like 105-yard wedge shot into the wind, and that pin is kind of dangerous," Munoz said. "I kind of took the safe route to the left, gave myself a 15-footer, made it. "On 18," he said, "it was a really nice drive, gave myself a sand wedge, and just went to keep it somewhere to the right of the hole, I knew everything was going to feed, so that's what I did, 12-footer and right down the middle."
