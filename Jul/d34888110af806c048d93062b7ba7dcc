AFP/Joel Saget WASHINGTON - Pfizer and BioNTech announced they would seek authorisation for a third dose of their COVID-19 vaccine to boost its efficacy, as the Delta variant drove devastating outbreaks in Asia and Africa and cases rose again in Europe and the United States. Delta is the most infectious strain of the virus since the start of the global pandemic early last year.

Pfizer and BioNTech said they expected that a third dose will perform well against the strain and that they would be seeking authorisation in the United States, Europe and other regions in the coming weeks.

The companies said they expected similar results for Delta -- but added they were also developing a vaccine specifically tailored to fight the deadly strain.
