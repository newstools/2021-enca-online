AFP/Heritage Auctions WASHINGTON - A cartridge of Nintendo's classic video game "Super Mario 64" set a world record Sunday, selling at auction for $1.56-million.

Dallas-based Heritage Auctions, which handled both sales, has not identified the buyers.Before Friday, the record for a video game auction was the sale in April of a 1986 "Super Mario Bros." cartridge: it went for $660,000. Retro video games have become increasingly popular among nostalgic collectors in recent years, driving up prices for old-school consoles and cartridges at auctions.
