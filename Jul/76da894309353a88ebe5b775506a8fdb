He spoke to crowds at his Nkandla homestead on Sunday.

This followed the court punishing him on Tuesday, for contempt of court, because he refused to testify at the State Capture Inquiry.

"The second decision was that I must pay the costs when I was not present." "Thirdly, they said since we know that a person has a right not to answer questions as per the Constitution but we want Zuma to answer. When I heard that, I said they are provoking me." "The judges who are supposed to protect me took my rights away, that means they are conspiring with this certain judge. I then decided I'm not going back to the State Capture Commission or even present myself to the judges."
