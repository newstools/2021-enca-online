Kagiso Rabada gets ready to bowl during the 1st Test between South Africa and West Indies. AFP/Randy Brooks ST LUCIA - Kagiso Rabada completed a five-wicket haul as South Africa formalised their demolition of the West Indies by an innings and 63 runs just before the lunch interval on the third day of the first Test in St Lucia on Saturday. Having taken just one wicket in the first innings on day one when the home side were routed for 97 after choosing to bat first, Rabada led the way for the Proteas in the West Indies second innings with figures of five for 34. It was his 10th five-wicket haul in Test cricket. The Caribbean side, trailing on first innings by 225 runs and resuming from an overnight position of 82 for four, were dismissed for 162. Wicketkeeper-batsman Quinton de Kock, with a Test-best unbeaten 141 in South Africa's only innings, was named man of the match. Only Roston Chase, with a top score of 62, offered any meaningful resistance to the South African bowlers, the next best effort being 14 from replacement opening batsman Kieran Powell, who came into the match on the first afternoon as a concussion replacement for middle-order batsman Nkrumah Bonner. Ironically, as well as Rabada bowled with the excellent support of Anrich Nortje, whose figures of three for 46 gave him seven wickets in the match, Chase's demise was not to any of the fast bowlers but the spin of Keshav Maharaj. Undone by a faster ball, Chase played on attempting a forcing shot. It was Maharaj's second wicket in quick succession after his first ball of the day accounted for Jason Holder, the former captain inexplicably offering no shot to a straight delivery. Joshua da Silva became the third West Indies batsman bowled offering no shot in the match. The second and final Test begins on Friday at the same venue.
