AFP/Paul Crock PARIS - Kevin Anderson has exited this year's French Open following a first-round defeat to South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. The South African was outplayed in the first two sets by Kwon who is ranked 91. A mid-match fightback saw Anderson win the third set, but it was not enough as Kwon regained his composure to close out the match in four sets. Anderson sent down 30 aces and 54 winners but it was his 46 unforced errors, which proved to be his downfall. The match lasted just over three hours. Lloyd Harris, the remaining flag-bearer in the men's singles, comes up against Britain's Cameron Norrie in the second round.
