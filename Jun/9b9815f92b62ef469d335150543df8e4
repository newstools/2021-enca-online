Sara Rogel was granted parole after being jailed for undergoing an abortion ZACATECOLUCA -A Salvadorian woman sentenced to three decades in prison for undergoing an abortion was released Monday after almost nine years behind bars, AFP confirmed. Dressed in white, Sara Rogel, 28, left the women's prison near Zacatecoluca, where she was joined by members of her family and her lawyer Karla Vaquerano of the abortion rights group ACDATEE. As a 20-year-old student and eight months pregnant, Rogel slipped and fell while washing clothes. Her family found her lying unconscious and took her to hospital, where authorities detained her on suspicion of having had an abortion.

Rogel hugged her relatives as she left the prison. Released on parole, she is banned from leaving the country and must undergo therapy with a psychologist. "She was deprived of freedom for almost nine years, in a sentence we believed was unfairly given," Vaquerano said. Socially conservative and devoutly Catholic El Salvador bans abortion in all cases, and sentences can range from eight to 50 years in cases of "aggravated homicide."
