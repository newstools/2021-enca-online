The covers remain on the Hampshire Bowl pitch as rain stops play in the fourth day of the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand at Southampton.Â AFP/Glyn KIRK LONDON - Rain once more interrupted the World Test Championship final between India and New Zealand at Southampton, with a heavy downpour preventing any play before lunch on Monday's fourth day. Overnight and early morning rain meant the pitch and square at Hampshire's headquarters remained fully covered when the match should have resumed at 10.30am local time). In a match where rain saw the whole of Friday's opening day washed out without a ball bowled, there was now a strong possibility another full day's play could be abandoned completely. Match referee Chris Broad, however, has a special dispensation to extend this final into a sixth day -- men's Tests usually only last a maximum of five days -- if he feels that will compensate for time lost in the game. An absorbing day of high-quality cricket on Sunday, cut short by bad light despite the use of the Hampshire Bowl's floodlights, ended with New Zealand 101-2 in reply to India's first innings 217 -- a deficit of 116 runs.
