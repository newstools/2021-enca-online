The youth gathered in Pretoria to demand, among other things, that ministers over 60 step down and let young people take over. Masego Rahlaga was there. Courtesy #DStv403 PRETORIA - Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is arrogant and must step down. That's the demand from the Progressive Youth Alliance which includes the ANC Youth League, the SA Students Congress and the Young Communist League. It also wants senior citizens in the cabinet to step down and make way for younger counterparts. The group marched to the finance ministry offices in Pretoria on Tuesday. * eNCA's Masego Rahlaga reports.
