He confirmed that the country will receive two million Johnson and Johnson doses before the end of the month. That's to replace the J&J jabs that had to be destroyed.

"We have received an indication from Johnson & Johnson that it expects to deliver around two-million vaccines to South Africa by the end of the month thus replacing the two-million doses that had to be destroyed." At least 700,000 more Pfizer vaccines are also on the way. Teachers and people over the age of 60 will be prioritised before the vaccine drive moves on to other groups.
