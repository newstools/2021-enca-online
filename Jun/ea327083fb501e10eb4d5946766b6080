File: Analysts say the driver for the rands' strength is high demand and high prices for South Africa's mining commodities. Pixabay/Karelien Kriel JOHANNESBURG - The rand starts the day back over R14 to the US dollar. The local currency took a steep slide on Wednesday in reaction to a surging US dollar. READ: Rand weakens against dollar The dollar rose after the US central bank indicated it expected to see two interest rate hikes in 2023. A higher interest rate environment strengthens the dollar and by extension, weakens emerging market currencies like the rand. A weaker rand can push up the petrol price and make other imported goods more expensive.
