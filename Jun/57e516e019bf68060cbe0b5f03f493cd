Former world welterweight king Floyd Mayweather and YouTube personality Logan Paul face-off during the media availability ahead of their exhibition boxing match. AFP/Chandan Khanna MIAMI - Floyd Mayweather has invited ridicule ahead of his latest return to the boxing ring but the unbeaten American couldn't care less. The dubious prospect of Mayweather, the 44-year-old former welterweight world champion who retired with an unblemished record of 50-0, taking on a 26-year-old internet star with just two bouts to his name, has been greeted with disdain in much of the sporting world. Sunday's bizarre exhibition bout against Logan Paul, with no judges ringside, is scheduled for eight rounds at Miami's Hard Rock Stadium. Mayweather is aware his first foray into the ring since another exhibition fight in Japan on New Year's Eve in 2018, which ended in the opening round, has left the boxing purists cold. Yet the American brushes off the criticism of those who believe he is tarnishing his legacy and the sport. "I don't really worry about the (pay-per-view) numbers," Mayweather told AFP. "I am just here to have fun and entertain. "Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. I live for Floyd Mayweather and I choose what I want to do. If I want to go out, have some fun and make $50, $60, $70, $100-million, let me do it. I am not bothering anyone. I am not out robbing or killing.  I am doing what I want to do. "I retired but I didn't retire from entertaining and making money." Mayweather broke the mould in 2017 when he came out of retirement to beat UFC star Conor McGregor in a money-spinning crossover event in Las Vegas which triggered the recent trend of boxers searching for opponents outside of the sport.
