Concerns are growing about primary school pupils heading back to class on a daily basis. This as South Africa goes deeper into the third wave of COVID-19 infections. The South African Democratic Teachers Union isn't pleased. Sadtu's Xolani Fakude spoke to Shahan Ramkissoon. JOHANNESBURG - COVID-19 infections at schools are increasing as the country goes deeper into the third wave. The South African Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) says a careful balancing act must remain in place to minimise outbreaks at schools, but make sure learning and teaching continue with minimal disruption. Sadtu says it will approach the education department if the safety of teachers and pupils is compromised.

"We will be the first ones... making the loudest noise that if the system is not ready to receive all the learners within a particular, regular timetable, therefore we will be the first ones to say let the department review on earlier pronouncements."
