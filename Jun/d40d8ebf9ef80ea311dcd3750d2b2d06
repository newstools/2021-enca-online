Springbok Morne Steyn (R) takes a shot at goal while playing for Stade Francais. JOHANNESBURG - Fly-half Morne Steyn, who turns 37 next month, was recalled by Rugby World Cup winner South Africa on Saturday for Test series against Georgia and the British and Irish Lions during July and August. He kicked the series-winning penalty from the halfway line in the second Test against the Lions in Pretoria 12-years ago. The playmaker returned home from playing for Stade Francais last year with the aim of coaching young fly-halves at the Bulls, his former club in Pretoria. But he soon re-established himself as the first choice No. 10 and the recent domestic successes of the franchise have owed much to the veteran. While Handre Pollard is likely to be the first-choice playmaker, the experience and goal-kicking ability of Steyn should make him a strong contender for a place on the bench. The match against Georgia on July 2 will be the first for the Springboks since the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan with the coronavirus pandemic preventing them playing at home or abroad last year.
