The country is now on alert level 3 of the lockdown. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced yesterday that tighter measures are needed as COVID-19 infections increase. Restrictions include a revised curfew from 10pm to 4am, and a limit on the number of people allowed to gather. There are also new alcohol restrictions in place but is moving the country to level 3, a good move by government? eNCA's Shahan Ramkissoon discusses this further with Professor Charles Parry from the South African Medical Research Council.

The South African Medical Research Council says urgent action is needed from government before the situation gets worse.

Professor Parry says stricter restrictions may be needed in order to curb the spread of the virus. South Africa has recorded its highest daily number of COVID-19 cases since January this year.
