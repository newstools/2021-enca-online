The Automobile Association says petrol is likely to be 23 cents more expensive. Diesel users will also not be spared and will pay 38 cents more a litre.

Petrol and diesel prices are largely determined by the oil price, as well as rand strength, given that South Africa must buy oil in US dollars. The AA says the increase will hit hard for consumers who use paraffin for cooking, lights, and heating, especially as South Africa heads into the heart of winter.
