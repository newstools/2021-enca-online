Max Verstappen leads Lewis Hamilton after hitting Monaco jackpot. AFP/Gonzalo Fuentes BAKU - Baku's street circuit is the medieval backdrop for Formula One's latest round of jousting between resurgent Red Bull and a Mercedes team anxious to move on from their Monaco misery. The Azerbaijan Grand Prix returns to the calendar for the first time since 2019 with Red Bull drinking in the view from atop the world championship standings. Max Verstappen's first Monaco triumph coupled with an insipid weekend for seventh-placed Lewis Hamilton saw the Dutchman deftly turn a 14 point deficit into a four point advantage in the race for the 2021 drivers' crown. In the constructors' standings, Red Bull transformed a 29 point deficit into a one point lead as they regained the summit for the first time since 2013. Unsurprisingly team principal Christian Horner was pleased as punch. "For us to come out leading both championships is beyond expectations," said the chief architect of Red Bull's revival. "When (Mercedes) have an off day it's important for us to bank a lot of points." While Monaco's narrow twisting street circuit makes overtaking notoriously difficult, Baku is an altogether different proposition. Boasting the longest straight -- 2.23km with speeds up to 370km/h -- of any circuit, Sunday's race will be fast and furious. And one where Mercedes can expect to rub some shine back on their Silver Arrows. Mercedes have taken pole and won three of the four grand prix staged in the former Soviet state's ancient capital on the Caspian Sea. But a different driver has taken the chequered flag each time, with Nico Rosberg in 2016, Daniel Ricciardo in 2017, Hamilton in 2018 and Valtteri Bottas, consigned to a DNF by a stubbornly immovable wheel nut in Monaco, the winner in 2019. Verstappen is hoping to continue that sequence but has yet to do better than fourth.
