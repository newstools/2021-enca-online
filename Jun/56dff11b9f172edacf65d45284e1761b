The residents say the local councillor is not doing anything to assist. "We tried to engage the councillor, he hasn't come anytime we've had several meetings," said community leader Lungile Lebethe. "We even took initiative to go to Eskom in Sandton. He didn't show up for a meeting yesterday [Wednesday]. All he says is just giving us feedback from Eskom." #DubeProtest Residents say they haven't had electricity for more than 6 months.
They have decided to barricade roads to get the attention of Eskom and their ward councilor.#eNCA pic.twitter.com/KDe62wBuVS
