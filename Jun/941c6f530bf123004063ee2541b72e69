Former president FW De Klerk's health is reportedly deteriorating. De Klerk is suffering from mesothelioma. eNCA's @Ronald Masinda reports.

While Chairman of the FW de Klerk Foundation Board, Dave Steward, told eNCA that de Klerk was hospitalised, a statement by the FW de Klerk Foundation released shortly afterwards, painted a different picture.
 
The Foundation says there has been "no discernible deterioration" in the health of the former president since he was diagnosed with mesothelioma in March.
 
De Klerk is suffering from mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the lining of the lungs.
 
According to the foundation; "He [de Klerk] is now considering the continuation of the course of immunotherapy that he has been following for the past two months".
 
The statement said the former president was not incapacitated.
 
"Mr De Klerk attended a meeting of the FW de Klerk Foundation Board yesterday [Monday] and comes into his office three or four times a week. He and his wife, Elita, hope to travel to Greece for a holiday as soon as COVID regulations permit."
 
Steward – who spoke to eNCA earlier - was, however, not forthcoming when clarity was sought about the hospitalization denial by the Foundation. He was only willing to tell eNCA that the former president “is fine.”
