At least 15 Golden Arrow buses have been burnt down since April last year. It's becoming the norm in the Western Cape where other modes of transport are attacked during protests. Community leaders say crime in Nyanga is increasingly getting out of hand. eNCA's Ronald Masinda has more. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A warzone and a no-go area. That's how residents of Nyanga are describing the township after days of protests. 75 Golden Arrow buses have been vandalised and several cars petrol-bombed during the demonstrations. Disgruntled taxi operators say they've had enough of being targeted by the City of Cape Town's law enforcement. Nyanga residents say they're now afraid of travelling by bus.

Santaco and the Western Cape transport department met on Thursday. All the stakeholders are hoping to reach a resolution that will see an end to similar protests. * eNCA's Ronald Masinda reports.
