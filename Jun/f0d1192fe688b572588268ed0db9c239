AFP/Valeria Macon NEW YORK - The MTV Video Music Awards will take place on September 12 in New York, the channel announced on Tuesday - the latest news that live entertainment is coming back in the city as it emerges from the pandemic. MTV has yet to announce which artists will perform at the event, to be staged in front of an audience at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. Last year, MTV initially announced that the 2020 edition would be held at the same arena before canceling that plan and hosting a scattered, behind-closed-doors ceremony with pre-recorded musical performances in several New York locations. The eligibility period for this year's videos is from July 2020 to June 2021.
