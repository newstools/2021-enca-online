Young people from Katlehong have taken to the streets to highlight the financial issues they face just to attend a school. They've taken up bicycles as a new mode of transport. Most of the bikes are donated by residents while others have been bought by parents who can afford them. eNCA's Nqobile Madlala finds out more. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The youth of Katlehong say not much has changed since 1976. The school environment has remained the same as that faced by their parents, transport costs are high and employment prospects remain grim. But they're refusing to give up. They've taken up bicycles as a new mode of transport, cycling between six and 10 kilometres every day to ensure they get an education. Most of the bikes are donated by residents while others have been bought by parents who can afford them. * eNCA's Nqobile Madlala reports.
