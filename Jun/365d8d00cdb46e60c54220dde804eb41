AFP/Angela Weiss NEW YORK - The world's largest Harry Potter store has finally opened in New York. If you're a die-hard fan, you'll find absolutely everything. The shop already appears to have a certain magic about it, as New Yorkers flocked in despite the pouring rain to get their merchandise. It aims to cast a spell on both new and old fans, with personalised wands, candies, a Butterbeer hall and other items. J.K. Rowling's coming-of-age series about young witches and wizards inspired the franchise.
