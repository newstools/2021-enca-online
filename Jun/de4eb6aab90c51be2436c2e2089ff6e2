Opposition parties say they don't believe his stand-in, Tourism Minister Mmamoloko Kuyabyi-Ngubane, is up to the task of answering questions on the department's controversial Digital Vibes contract. A sub judice rule invoked two weeks ago to excuse Mkhize from Parliament has been found to have been ill-placed.
