2019 Wimbledon champions Novak Djokovic and Simona Halep LONDON - Defending champion Simona Halep pulled out of Wimbledon with a calf injury as Novak Djokovic learned Friday he will face Britain's Jack Draper at the start of his quest for a 20th Grand Slam title.

"I can honestly say that I'm really down and upset about having to take this decision," said the world number three. "This period has been difficult but to miss the last two Majors has made it even more challenging mentally and physically."
