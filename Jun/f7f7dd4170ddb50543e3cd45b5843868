The country has been battling with load-shedding for 13 years. "If you look into the integrated resource plan, it is proposing to put a total of 16,000 megawatts on the grid," Mantashe said.

Mantashe said a negative narrative has been developed around energy instead of quantifying progress being made. "The fact that we have not gone to extreme load-shedding of Level 6, level what. "I don't want to take big responsibility of that because Eskom is not falling under the minister of energy, but progress is being made."
