She's set to run the 5000m at the International Athletics Meeting in Liege, Belgium but the event comes a day after the IOC's cut-off date for qualifying.
Wednesday's competition will not count as a qualifier.
Semenya needed a time of 15 minutes and 10 seconds to qualify.
Her personal best in the 5000m is 15 minutes and 32 seconds.
The three-time 800m world champion has been forced to run outside her favoured events due to World Athletics' testosterone regulations.
These require Semenya to take hormones if she is wants to continue, in the 800 and 1,500 metres.
