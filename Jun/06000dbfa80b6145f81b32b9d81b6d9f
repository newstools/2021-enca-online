The tournament was originally meant to happen in India but it is emerging from a COVID-19 surge in April and May and experts fear a new wave of cases later this year. "Our priority is to deliver the ICC Men's T20 World Cup 2021 safely, in full and in its current window," said Geoff Allardice, acting chief executive of the International Cricket Council. "Whilst we are incredibly disappointed not to be hosting the event in India, the decision gives us the certainty we need to stage the event in a country that is a proven international host of multi-team events in a bio-secure environment." The Board of Control for Cricket in India had already said on Monday the tournament would be shifted. The event will take place from 17 October to 14 November. It will be held across four venues -- the Dubai International Stadium, the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi, the Sharjah Stadium, and the Oman Cricket Academy Ground. The ICC had given the BCCI a deadline of the end of June to decide the host country for T20's showpiece event due to the high number of COVID-19 cases in India. The BCCI had already moved the suspended Indian Premier League to the UAE in September-October after the T20 tournament was halted on May 4 due to a number of players and team officials being infected with Covid.
