Former president Kgalema Motlanthe. JOHANNESBURG - Former President Kgalema Motlanthe says the divisions within the ANC in Free State will be settled with time. Motlanthe was tasked with resolving the political impasse in the province. This after the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the provincial leadership elected in 2018 be dissolved.

"The process involves all sides, everybody was involved in the discussions and they owned up that they were themselves involved in dividing the organisation and really pleaded that they be given an opportunity to unite it," he said. "It is a work in progress but I think we are off to a good start."
