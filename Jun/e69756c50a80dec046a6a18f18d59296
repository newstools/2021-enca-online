Cameroonian Roger Nkodo Dang served two three-year terms as the president since 2015. He was preceded by Nigeria's Bethel Amadi, and before that Moussa Idriss of Cameroon. The parliament sits for three weeks twice a year at its headquarters in Midrand. Formed in 2004, the assembly is the legislative branch of the African Union, but in reality, it is merely a consultative body. Its members are elected through their national legislatures. - Additional reporting AFP The shocking scenes of violence at the #PanAfricanParliament today tarnish the image of this honourable institution.
