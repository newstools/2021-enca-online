Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The motive for the brutal murder of an SAA flight attendant in Johannesburg is unclear. But there are suspicions of a hate crime. Aubrey Boshoga was stabbed multiple times, his death sparking an outcry in the LQBTQI community. "He had no enemies, I do suspect that it can be a hate crime but I wouldn't say it at this point because I don't have evidence," said Aubrey's sister Josephine Boshoga. "But so far what I heard is that the people he hanged around with that day, he was the only gay guy." Boshoga has been described as a loving socialite who served the national carrier with pride. Gauteng police are investigating. * eNCA's Nkosazana Dambuza reports.
