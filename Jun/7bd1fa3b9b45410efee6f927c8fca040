Gareth Bale last scored for Wales in October 2019 BAKU - Captain Gareth Bale said Wednesday's win over Turkey in Baku puts Wales in a "great position" to reach the Euro 2020 last 16. Aaron Ramsey and Connor Roberts scored to send Wales top of Group A on four points before Italy host Switzerland later on. "The victory puts us in a great position," Bale told the BBC. "If you'd have offered us four points at the start we would've bitten your hand off," he added.
