Police near Kwamhlanga in Mpumalanga are searching for the driver of a car that crashed, killing nine pupils and injuring 18 others. Survivors, many of whom are now pensioners living with horrific injuries, are still haunted by the incident and have now opened a case with police. But legal expert Marius du Toit says it might be too late for a prosecution. "The fact that nine lives were taken... it should have been investigated by the police," Du Toit said. "But that being said, we have seen in the past there have been instances where crimes have been wiped under the carpet and where nothing was done or where a phoney decision was made at the time." Du Toit said the original inquest records must be found to determine what the findings by the magistrate's court were. "I can only imagine on the facts that we have at this stage, it's clear that culpable homicide was committed, it's clear that a prosecution ought to have been instituted."
