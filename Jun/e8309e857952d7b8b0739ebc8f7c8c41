Mokgoro says unemployment is skyrocketing and the province can't afford to have such a big factory close down. Clover announced earlier this week that it would relocate its largest cheese factory in Lichtenburg to Queensburgh in Durban. It says this is due to poor water and electricity supply from the Ditsobotla municipality.
