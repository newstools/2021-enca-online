I said to him, 'I almost didn't recognise you - you had a lot more hair during your Led Zeppelin days.' He walked away. Fair enough, really. It must get tiring to be constantly asked about Stairway To Heaven fifty years later." -- Parody Twitter site @GalacticKeegan on the manager of the Wales team at Euro 2000.
