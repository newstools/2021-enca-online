Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South Africa’s youth faces deepening unemployment and are expected to deal with all of society’s ills, but they must be incorporated into the economy. That’s the message from Johannesburg mayor Geoff Makhubo. READ: Makhubo calls for greater unity in dealing with youth unemployment He's paid tribute to Hector Pieterson, the Soweto boy who became one of the first to be killed by police during the student uprising of 1976. Meanwhile, the youth of Soweto say they are torn between gratitude for new opportunities and navigating the South African society’s culture of rape and violence. * eNCA's Govan Whittles reports.
