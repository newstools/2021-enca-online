Arendse was confirmed as the organisation's eighth independent director as the Annual General Meeting resumed last night. Saturday's AGM was adjourned following concerns by the members' council about Arendse's inclusion. READ: Rihan Richards elected new CSA president Issues raised were around the former CSA President's previous involvement with the organisation as well as public utterances made about the federation but those matters appear to have been ironed out. Arendse is one of eight independent directors appointed by a nominations panel. The other seven members are from within CSA's structures.
