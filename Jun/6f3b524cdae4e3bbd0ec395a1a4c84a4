The Taj Mahal has reopened to visitors as India loosened restrictions following an easing of the country's coronavirus surge. AFP/Money Sharma MUMBAI - The Taj Mahal reopened to visitors on Wednesday as Indian authorities loosened restrictions following an easing in the country's devastating recent coronavirus surge. Infections and deaths soared to record levels in April and May, overwhelming health services in some places and prompting lockdowns and other curbs. Cases have declined in recent weeks, with several major cities including New Delhi and Mumbai easing many restrictions. In Agra, where the Taj Mahal is located, tourist guides and shopkeepers were upbeat as India's top tourist attraction sprung back to life Wednesday. The 17th-century monument of love built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan was shut in March last year, reopened in September and closed again in April. Crowds were thin on the first day of the reopening, with authorities restricting visitor numbers to 650 per day. COVID-19 precautions meant visitors were not allowed to touch the shining marble mausoleum, but those making the pilgrimage to one of the New Seven Wonders of the World were still delighted.
