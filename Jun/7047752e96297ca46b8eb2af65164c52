JOHANNESBURG - State arms manufacturer Denel may soon enter its final battle as it faces a legal bid to have it liquidated. SAAB Grintek Defence has approached the high court in Pretoria for the winding up of the company. It says Denel’s affairs should be handed over to a liquidator to allow its creditors to file claims according to the Insolvency Act. READ: Denel owes workers R500m The matter relates to a contract for SAAB to produce 211 Fire Control Computers for the Badger Infantry Combat Vehicles. The deal is known as the Hoefyster Agreement.
