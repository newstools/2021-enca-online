File: Money. eNCA JOHANNESBURG - The rand enters the week on a strong footing against the US dollar. The local currency is at its highest level since February 2019, at just above R13.40 to the US dollar. WATCH: Rand at its strongest since February 2019 These gains came late on Friday when the dollar weakened, after a worse than expected jobs report was released. The rand has been making huge strides in recent months thanks largely to higher prices for South Africa’s mining commodities. A stronger rand eases inflation and makes it more affordable for importers.
