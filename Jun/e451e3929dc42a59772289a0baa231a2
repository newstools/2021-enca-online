People have been streaming to KwaHlatini village, searching for riches. ButÂ experts say it's highly unlikely the stones will turn out to be valuable. WATCH | A KZN diamond dash or desperation? Residents however say they'll continue digging regardless. Thousands have flocked to the outskirts of KwaHlathi village after a cattle herder last week unearthed a handful of unidentified crystal-like stones. News of the finding spread fast, triggering a rush to the site despite messages of caution by the government warning the stones could be worthless. - Additional reporting AFP
