Courtesy #DStv403 MALMESBURY - Western Cape health authorities are racing to get senior citizens vaccinated before the third wave hits. Dozens of vaccine sites set to open in the Cape Winelands, Central Karoo, Overberg, Garden Route and the West Coast. Former homeland ambassador Evita Bezuidenhout got her jab on Tuesday. READ: COVID-19 Vaccine | Agreement for workplace vaccination "It would not be a bad idea to allow businesses who can, to vaccinate their workers and keep our economy going so we can afford the vaccines," Bezuidenhout said. "Who are these people? They are also the miners, the bus drivers, supermarket tellers. With an economy this bad, everyone is a frontline worker." The Western Cape is aiming to have 111 of its 274 vaccine sites up and running by the end of this week. * Ayesha Ismail reports. .@TannieEvita Bezuidenhout received her COVID-19 vaccination in the West Coast District earlier today!
