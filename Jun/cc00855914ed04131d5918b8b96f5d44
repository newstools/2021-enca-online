AFP/Adrian Dennis JOHANNESBURG - Acting Health Minister Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane says tougher action is needed to curb the spread of the Delta variant. Kubayi-Mmaoloko announced on Saturday that the variant first identified in India is what is contributing to the high number of new Covid-19 infections in South Africa. Health experts say the Delta variant is much more transmissible than other variants and can reinfect people who have been sick from the previous variants.
