The body of late president Robert Mugabe lies in state at the Mugabe's residency in Harare on 12 September 2019. HARARE - Three of late former Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's children, are challenging a traditional chief's order, for his body to be exhumed and reburied at the National Heroes Acre. Bona, Bellarmine and Tinotenda Mugabe have filed a court application, arguing that traditional Chief Zvimba acted outside his jurisdiction, when he approached a village court to hold a hearing into Mugabe's burial. The chief summoned Grace Mugabe, to answer to allegations she didn't follow tradition when she buried her late husband.
