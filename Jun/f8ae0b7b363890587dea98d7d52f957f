This is in connection to the multi-million-rand Digital Vibes contract that was awarded irregularly by the department. There have been growing calls for Ramaphosa to fire Mkhize. "While it is disheartening to read on a daily basis about corruption allegations. It is significant that now, much of what is in the public domain is a result of work being done by institutions such as the SIU, the Hawks, The National Prosecuting Authority, the Auditor General and others," said Ramaphosa. "Institutions charged with uncovering and prosecuting corruption are doing what is expected of them," he added.
