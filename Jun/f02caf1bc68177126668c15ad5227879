South Africa's not only in the grips of a third COVID-19 wave, it's also struggling with an energy crisis. President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced changes to the Electricity Regulation Act. That means Nersa's licensing threshold is increasing - from 1 to 100 megawatts but will this ease the pressure on Eskom? eNCA's Shahan Ramkissoon speaks to Sikhonathi Mantshantsha.

But, the utility says it could take up to two years to see the benefits of that decision. "Remember investors, those companies and anyone else who needs to install their own technology, their own electricity will start making the arrangements, except those that had already started such as companies like Goldfields," said Eskom spokesperson, Sikonathi Mantshantsha. "Those that are about to make that decision, this will take up to about two years for them to finally see their electricity from investments."
