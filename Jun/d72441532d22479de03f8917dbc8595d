Ashok Kurmi spends his days off disinfecting public spaces, distributing face masks and spreading awareness about Covid-19 "The municipal workers wear PPE kits that scare slum dwellers, particularly children," Kurmi told AFP. "With the help of different costumes, I can spread awareness without scaring people. I am able to help them a little." Over the past year he has dressed up as Santa Claus, Mickey Mouse, Doraemon and Marvel superhero Spiderman. But his clown get-up is the most popular by far, he said. Ashok Kurmi works at a pharmaceutical company but says voluntary social work is his passion On a recent visit to India's largest slum Dharavi, groups of children followed him, chanting "joker, joker" and offering their hands to be sanitised. With the help of visual aids and posters, Kurmi patiently showed them how to wash their hands and wear face masks correctly. The efforts of volunteers like Ashok Kurmi have become even more important as Mumbai prepares for a third coronavirus wave "I have worked at a pharmaceutical company for the last 15 years but social work is my passion," he said. He spends around 15,000 rupees ($205) -- a third of his monthly salary -- on buying costumes, make-up supplies and sanitation equipment. As Mumbai prepares for a third coronavirus wave, his efforts have become even more important.
