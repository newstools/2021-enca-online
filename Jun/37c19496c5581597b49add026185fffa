The IATA warns that European air travel delays could lengthen in the coming months unless health control processes are improved. AFP/Andreas Solaro PARIS - A year after the coronavirus pandemic emptied airports, air travel associations fear chaos during Europe's summer holiday season as travellers could wait hours before boarding planes due to health checks. Strict controls are still in place at most European airports even though vaccination campaigns are making progress and infection rates are falling. READ: As air travel picks up, United says it is hiring pilots The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reported last week that on average, people travelling at peak times now stay twice as long at airports -- three hours -- compared with 2019. That time is generally spent checking in, passing security and immigration controls, picking up checked bags and making it through customs. And there's the new reality: Airlines having to check passengers' Covid tests, temperature and other health documents. The wait time has increased even though the volume of traffic is "only about 30 percent of pre-COVID-19 levels", an IATA statement said.

If traffic fully returns to normal, the IATA estimates people could spend up to eight hours getting to their planes and back out at their destinations. Verification of Covid tests, passenger location forms and quarantine documents "vary depending on their point of origin and destination, based on rules which remain largely unaligned and unstable across Europe," ACI Europe noted.
