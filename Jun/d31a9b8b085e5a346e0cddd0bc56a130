South Africa's Luvo Manyonga. AFP/Fabrice Coffrini JOHANNESBURG - Luvo Manyonga was once South Africa's ultimate sporting tale of redemption. But those days now seem far away for the long jump ace. Manyonga has been hit with a four-year ban by the Athletics Integrity Unit. The 30-year-old fell foul of anti-doping rules when his whereabouts could not be confirmed three times inside a 12-month span. READ: Luvo Manyonga provisionally suspended The period in question began in November 2019. It's the former world champion reigning Commonwealth Games champ's second doping ban. He had served an 18-month suspension back in 2012. Manyonga's current ban will end in December 2024 but he could yet appeal.
