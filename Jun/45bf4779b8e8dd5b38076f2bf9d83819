Olympic organisers want to keep visitors under close supervision in Tokyo. AFP/Kazuhiro Nogi TOKYO - Overseas journalists covering the Tokyo Olympics will have their movements tracked by GPS, the Games president said on Tuesday, and could have their passes revoked if they break the rules. Organisers of the pandemic-postponed 2020 Games, which open in just over six weeks, are trying to reassure a sceptical public that the mega-event can be held safely under strict virus rules. The about 6,000 reporters visiting Japan for the Olympics must provide a detailed list of areas they will visit for their first two weeks in Japan, such as sports venues and hotels.

"To make sure that people don't go to places other than the places where they are registered to go, we will use GPS to strictly manage their behaviour," Hashimoto said before a Tokyo 2020 executive board meeting. Reporters will be urged to stay in designated hotels rather than private lodgings, she added.

Athletes will also face tight restrictions on their movements as well as being tested daily for the virus. Overseas fans have already been banned from attending the event, and organisers will decide later this month how many domestic spectators -- if any -- can watch the competitions.
