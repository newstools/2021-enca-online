Six people died and scores were injured when the commuter bus they were traveling in caught alight on Moloto Road. READ: Putco bus accident | Investigation underway Mpumalanga Premier Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane was supposed to report back to them Thursday, on what could have led to the deadly fire. It's been a month since their loved ones passed away in a fire where they were burnt beyond recognition, and they are still waiting for DNA tests to be concluded. Owen Kabini, one bereaved family member said, "they told us that if it’s bone marrow samples, they will have results after three weeks. If it’s blood it could even be 24 hours. So, because they told us it’s bone marrow samples, it means we have to wait for three weeks but they haven’t even started yet.” The premier has since promised to commission a company to conduct swift DNA tests as police are battling with a backlog. All the Kabini family asks is to be able to bury their mother. “I don’t even know who to ask anymore but we’re are not asking government anymore. The police must release the samples to wherever DNA testing has been paid for. Then we’ll wait for those three weeks.” The Putco bus company has committed a R100,000 to each family to help with the burials as soon as DNA results are released.
