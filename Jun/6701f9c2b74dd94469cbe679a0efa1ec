Visitors look at projected paintings and drawings at the Van Gogh exhibit in Dubai. AFP/Giuseppe Cacace DUBAI - Shoppers and art lovers will soon be able to step into Van Gogh masterpieces projected onto walls and floors in an immersive experience in a Dubai shopping centre. The installation by French firm Culturespaces is reminiscent of "Loving Vincent", the 2017 drama chronicling the life of the Dutch post-impressionist, in which moving images were created using frames painted on canvas. The exhibition, which will showcase digital displays of works from the Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Remy collection and others including Irises, opens on 1 July and will run until mid next year.

The exhibition is in the mould of the Atelier des Lumieres in Paris, where classic works are shown alongside complementary sound and visual displays. The Dubai Mall exhibition seeks to "connect visitors directly to the art", Oriol said. Culturespaces has opened a number of digital art exhibitions around the world, including in France and South Korea, and is scheduled to launch another in New York next year.
