The veterans' president, Kebby Maphatsoe, says Zuma’s rights have been undermined and the Constitutional Court justices are not impartial. READ: Zuma has 5 days to turn himself in "Want the transformation of the judiciary so it will be impartial. It doesn't mean the view of the majority is always correct," Maphatsoe said. "Sometimes, in the future, you will realise that the views of the minority were correct. You can't undermine the view of the minority."
