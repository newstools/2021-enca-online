Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip have been isolating at Windsor Castle for the past year. AFP/Chris Jackson LONDON - The annual military parade in central London for Queen Elizabeth II's official birthday has been cancelled for a second year owing to the coronavirus pandemic, Buckingham Palace said. The "Trooping the Colour" event in June normally features hundreds of personnel from Britain's most prestigious regiments for a centuries-old spectacle of pageantry in front of thousands of spectators. Last year, because of the health crisis, it was switched to a low-key celebration in the grounds of Windsor Castle west of London, and the palace said the same was likely again. "Following consultation with government and other relevant parties it has been agreed that the Queen's official birthday parade, also known as Trooping the Colour, will not go ahead this year in its traditional form in central London," a statement read. "Options for an alternative parade, in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle, are being considered." Elizabeth (94)Â and her 99-year-old husband Prince Philip have for the past year been isolating at Windsor, as their age puts them in a high-risk category for coronavirus.
