AFP/Michael Bradley WELLINGTON - A scintillating performance from Richie Mo'unga led the Canterbury Crusaders to a 43-27 victory over the Auckland Blues in the clash of the New Zealand titans and cemented their grip on Super Rugby Aotearoa on Sunday. Both sides went into the match unbeaten and the Blues had hometown advantage, but they could not consistently match the relentless power of the Crusaders pack coupled with Mo'unga's direction of a more enterprising backline. In a clash that featured 20 All Blacks, the Blues were still in with a chance at nine points down with seven minutes remaining. But when Ofa Tu'ungafasi was yellow-carded, the Crusaders cashed in on the one-man advantage and extended the lead with a further try. In addition to directing the Crusaders attack, Mo'unga scored one of their four tries, converted them all and added five penalties for a match haul of 28 points. The Blues conceded 16 penalties and captain Paddy Tuipulotu said that proved costly. "There was a lot of wrongdoing and against a side like the Crusaders you can't have that and the scoreboard showed it," he said. The first three times the Crusaders entered the Blues 22 they moved the scoreboard with two tries and a penalty. After an early Otere Black penalty had the Blues 3-0, the Crusaders replied with a try to Jack Goodhue following up a well-weighted grubber kick from Bryn Hall. In the closing stages, Kurt Eklund scored his second try to keep the Blues in touch only for Mo'unga to respond for the Crusaders and when Hoskins Sotutu scored for the Blues, a try to Crusaders' wing Sevu Reece put the result beyond doubt.
