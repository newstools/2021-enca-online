Leatherback turtle hatchlings. AFP/Jimin Lai QUITO - Nine leatherback turtles -- the largest endangered marine turtle in the world -- were hatched along the coast of Ecuador, the Ministry of Environment said. The Dermochelys coriacea -- the turtle's scientific name -- eggs were artificially incubated on the Punta Bikini beach, in the Manabi province in the southwest of the country. Rangers in the region had moved their nest after a harsh winter hit the coastal region.

In January, 60 of the leatherback turtles, which can measure up to three metres long and weigh up to a ton, were born in the South American country, also in Manabi. "On the Manabi coast, this is the second time we have carried out an incubation of this species, which has a low reproduction rate of just 50 percent of eggs hatching," the statement said.

It is in critical danger of disappearing in the eastern Pacific. Leatherback turtle nests were also found along the Ecuadorian coast in 2015 and 2017, but the eggs did not hatch.
