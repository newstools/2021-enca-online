Bernard le Roux has won 46 Tests since his France debut in 2013. AFP/Anne-Christine Poujoulat PARIS - Head coach Fabien Galthie compared Bernard le Roux to a "decathlete" on Wednesday as the lock returned to France's starting lineup in five changes for this week's Six Nations decider with Scotland in Paris. The hosts will lift their first trophy since 2010 by scoring four tries or more in a victory of over 20 points on Friday. If Les Bleus fail then Wales, who lost at the Stade de France last Saturday, will win the title. South African-born Le Roux missed two games with a thigh injury and replaces Romain Taofifenua in a new-look second-row with Swann Rebbadj starting for the first time instead of the banned Paul Willemse. "Bernard is a type of decathlete. He's very active and super present on the field be that defensively or in attack," Galthie said. "He does a lot of jobs. He's very experienced and counts a lot for us since we took over the project," he added. Castres' Anthony Jelonch comes in for Dylan Cretin at openside flanker for a fixture re-scheduled from late-February after a Covid-19 outbreak in the France set-up. Jelonch impressed in last weekend's victory after coming on for the final half an hour. "It's true that Anthony took part in the end of the match where he was precious with and without the ball," Galthie said. "I'm always looking for balance. The balance consists of finding the good mix between power on the floor and in the air and the presence there," he added.
