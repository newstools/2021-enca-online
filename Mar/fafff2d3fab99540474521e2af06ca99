Emergency services reported receiving more than 1,000 calls for help and carrying out about 100 flood rescues. AFP/Saeed Khan SYDNEY - Sydney braced for its worst flooding in decades on Sunday after record rainfall caused its largest dam to overflow and as deluges prompted mandatory mass evacuation orders along Australia's east coast. Emergency services ordered people living in low-lying areas on the city's north-western fringes to flee to safety, as authorities warned of a potentially "life-threatening" situation in New South Wales state. It came after the Warragamba Dam, which provides much of the drinking water for Sydney, spilt over on Saturday afternoon -- causing officials to warn the downstream Hawkesbury River was expected to peak at levels not seen since 1961. READ: Record rains, flooding prompt evacuations in Australia "It is one of the biggest floods we are likely to see for a very long time," Bureau of Meteorology flood operations manager Justin Robinson said. Floodwaters had already risen in several areas, prompting mass evacuations, and officials said another 4,000 people could be told to leave their homes in the coming days. Authorities urged residents to heed the "dozens" of official warnings in place across affected areas, with State Emergency Service assistant commissioner Dean Storey saying those in evacuation zones "must leave immediately". People had already begun flocking to evacuation centres in towns north of Sydney on Saturday as torrential rains pummelled a vast coastal region already soaked by an unusually wet summer.
