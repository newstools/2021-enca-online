AFP/Chris Delmas SAN FRANCISCO - Uber is spinning off the sidewalk robotics division of the Postmates delivery service acquired last year, creating a new company called Serve Robotics. A statement from Serve said it had an unspecificed amount of seed funding from venture capital firm Neo with participation by Uber and other investors. Serve Robotics "will continue spearheading the development of a new form of mobility by creating autonomous robots to deliver goods in urban environments," a statement from the new company said.

The move comes with Uber narrowing its focus on ride-hailing and meal delivery, while spinning off or selling non-core operations such as its e-bike division. Serve meanwhile enters a crowded market for robotic delivery which has gained traction in recent years.

"Over the next two decades, new mobility robots will enter every aspect of our lives -- first moving food, then everything else." According to Serve, nearly half of all restaurant deliveries in the US are within a 40-minute walk, offering opportunities for robotic delivery. Uber last year announced plans to buy Postmates for $2.65-billion in stock, in a move shaking up the sector which has seen surging growth during the coronavirus pandemic.
