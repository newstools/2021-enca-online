India's captain Virat Kohli. AFP/Sajjad Hussain AHMEDABADÂ - England's Ben Stokes got India skipper Virat Kohli out for nought as the hosts suffered setbacks in their first-innings run-chase in the fourth Test on Friday. India, chasing England's 205, reached 80-4 at lunch on the second day, with Rohit Sharma batting on 32. Stokes caught Ajinkya Rahane in the slips off Jimmy Anderson's bowling in the final over before the break. All-rounder Stokes, a day after a confrontation with Kohli, took the captain's prized scalp after he edged a rising delivery to wicketkeeper Ben Foakes. Kohli had approached Stokes on Thursday, prompting the umpire to intervene, after bowler Mohammed Siraj said the batsman "insulted" him. Stokes later said his exchange with Kohli was between "two blokes who care about what they do and two guys who definitely don't back down". England will be encouraged by the way they have stifled the Indian batsmen so far. Anderson has bowled eight maidens in 11.5 overs as India struggled for runs. He took Shubman Gill for nought on Thursday. With India resuming on 24-1, spinner Jack Leach trapped Cheteshwar Pujara for 17 early in the morning session. On Thursday, spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Axar Patel took seven wickets between them as England's batting failed again. India, 2-1 up in the series, need to avoid defeat to book a meeting with New Zealand in the World Test Championship final at Lord's in June.
