The deal to lease the Philips brand name will add further annual payments that would take the overall value of the sale to around 4.4 billion euros ($5.2-billion) when completed, Philips added. Despite the sale, the home appliances business would remain headquartered in the Netherlands, it said. "We look forward to joining forces with Philips to expand into new markets and capture more growth opportunities globally," Lei Zhang, the founder and chief executive of Hillhouse Capital, said in the Philips statement.
