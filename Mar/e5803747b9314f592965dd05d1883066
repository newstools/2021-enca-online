"We've agreed they'll clear the roads. We will deal with issues that have been raised in this meeting. "You remember that last year we gave Ugo a number of water tankers, we have a constitutional responsibility to support municipalities. But we also gave them some of the grants to try to resolve the issue of the water. "There are also boreholes that are being drilled as we speak, we've established a team that have to deal with issues and redirect resources to areas that need to be dealt with."
