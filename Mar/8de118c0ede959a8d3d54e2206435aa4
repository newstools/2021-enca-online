There have also been other issues troubling the party including the Public Protector saga, Radical Economic Transformation forces and even MK Veterans Association spokesperson, Carl Niehaus. READ: ANC taking urgent action against corruption: Mabe ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said the step aside issue could be addressed despite not being an agenda item. "You are not the first journalist to locate the issue of step aside on the agenda of the NEC. We do not have such an agenda item on our own, we have already shared what we have on the agenda," "We had shared all the issues to be at the centre which are the COVID-19 and vaccine roll-out, tertiary education funding and ANCYL." READ: ANC NEC meeting to resume later on Monday The spokesperson said an issue does not need to be on the agenda to be discussed. "The issue would have come across as part of the discussion of the integrity commission reports, I am trying to take you there so that you can locate it in context," he said. "The expectation that is if everything goes well the NEC should reconvene at 7pm and the only reason why we are not reconvening earlier is that comrades in the ANC -- the president of the African National Congress is also the president of the Republic -- he has other issues of national importance that he has to be dealing with."
