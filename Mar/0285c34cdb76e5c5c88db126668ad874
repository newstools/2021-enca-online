They start their day by collecting sand and gravel, sometimes from the side of the road or homes. From Monday to Sunday at 9am until 4pm, a group of men are on the streets fixing potholes in Wallacedene, Cape Town. eNCA's Nobesuthu Hejana has the story. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Potholes are a motorist's nightmare, especially on rainy days. But a group of four men from Wallacedene in Cape Town are taking matters into their own hands. They're coming up with ideas to earn an income and fix potholes in the area. All members of this group are currently unemployed but say donations from as little as R1 from motorists do go a long way, though they may not be enough to feed their families. The men hope their passion to fix potholes may lead to them finding permanent employment. * eNCA's Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
