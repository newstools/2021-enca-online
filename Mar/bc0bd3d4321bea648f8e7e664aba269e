AFP/Marco Bertorello PARMA - Italy got their World Cup qualifying campaign off the markÂ on Thursday with a comfortable 2-0 victory over Northern Ireland in Group C. Domenico Berardi and Ciro Immobile scored the crucial goals in the first half at the Stadio Ennio Tardini in Parma as the hosts extended their unbeaten run under coach Roberto Mancini to 23 games. Mancini took over after the four-time World Cup winners failed to qualify for the 2018 tournament, missing the finals for the first time in 60 years. Since then Mancini has the best record of any Azzurri coach in the last 50 years with a run including 10 wins in their Euro 2020 qualifiers. "The first half was excellent, we could have scored more goals," said Mancini. "We'll review the second because we could have done better. "It's hard for everyone to pick up and play after five months. It was important to start well." Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci earned his 100th cap, playing in a four-man defence alongside veteran captain Giorgio Chiellini, Emerson and Alessandro Florenzi. "The failure to qualify for the last World Cup is an open wound," said Bonucci. "We must take the rage, the hunger to conquer everything that Italy deserves from it." Ian Baraclough's Northern Ireland are bidding to qualify for the World Cup for the first time since 1986.
