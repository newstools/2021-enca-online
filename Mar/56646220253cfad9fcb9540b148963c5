Aramco has been battered by low oil prices and a collapse in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. AFP/Fayez Nureldine RIYADH - Energy giant Saudi Aramco on Sunday posted a 44.4 percent slump in 2020 net profit due to lower crude prices, as the coronavirus pandemic weighed heavily on global demand. Aramco, Saudi Arabia's cash cow, has revealed consecutive falls in profits since it began disclosing earnings in 2019, piling pressure on government finances as Riyadh pursues multi-billion dollar projects to diversify the oil-reliant economy. "Aramco achieved a net income of $49-billion in 2020," the company said in a statement -- down from $88.2-billion in 2019. Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, was hammered last year by the double whammy of low prices and sharp cuts in production. "The company displayed strong financial resilience in one of the most challenging periods for the industry," the Aramco statement said. "Revenues were impacted by lower crude oil prices and volumes sold, and weakened refining and chemicals margins." Crude prices have risen in recent weeks to over $60 per barrel. But analysts say the Saudi giant is bracing for a possible further waves of coronavirus infections that could undermine a tentative global economic recovery.
