Several users shared screenshots showing messages from Twitter saying their account was being limited for violating the platform's rules, after they had tweeted a message which included the word "Memphis." Twitter late Sunday acknowledged the error and said it had been fixed.

The French soccer club tweeted a picture of their Dutch forward with the message: "Hey, @Twitter -- can we talk about him yet?" Others joined in with jokes about the apparent taboo. "When bots flood our comments with 'say the m word'," NBA team the Memphis Grizzlies tweeted with a video of a player blocking a shot. Some users expressed mock concern about the taboo covering the Tennessee home of rock'n'roll where Elvis Presley grew up. Others referenced the Monty Python comedy "Life of Brian," with lawyer George Conway, a vocal Donald Trump critic, linking to the scene where a man is about to be stoned for saying the word "Jehovah."

Now ban the nazis, please," one user tweeted.
