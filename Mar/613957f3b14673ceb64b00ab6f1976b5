Courtesy of #DStv403 HARARE - Six MPs of Zimbabwe's main opposition party, the MDC-Alliance -- including the party's vice president -- have been expelled from Parliament. This after their former party, the PDP, wrote to the National Assembly saying they have crossed the floor. MDC-Alliance vice president Tendai Biti has accused the little-known PDP party of being used by President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to destroy the opposition.

"Zimbabwe is run by cartels that are controlled and there are life and blood of (ruling) Zanu PF," Biti said. "We have exposed these cartels, their control of foreign currency and their control of fuel sector."

But the PDP party's spokesperson Nqobizitha Khumalo insists the expulsion of the six MPs was constitutional.
