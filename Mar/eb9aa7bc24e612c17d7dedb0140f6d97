Courtesy of #DStv403 MARGATE - Fed-up residents on KwaZulu-Natal's South Coast have given an ultimatum to the Ugu District Municipality to fully restore water services. The interruptions plaguing the tourist destination for years have become more frequent in recent months. Some companies reported as many as 15 days without water in February, which has been detrimental to their survival.

"We demand that they tell us how they're going to solve this problem, how they're going to give us 100 percent water," said Oliver Ransome of the KZN South Coast Ratepayers' Association. The Ugu District Municipality says residents owe it about half a billion rand, which is putting pressure on its cashflow.

The municipality has been very open that we are running an infrastructure that has been designed years ago, designed for a particular group of people," said the municipality's France Zama. "What this leadership has done, they have extended water supply which has increased the demand than the supply that we have. In terms of ensuring extend the supply, an uninterrupted supply to the district we will require R2-billion."
Residents want a response that should detail a concrete plan to provide a sustainable water supply from the district municipality by next month. * eNCA's Dasen Thathiah reports.
