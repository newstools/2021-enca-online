Meghan Markle and her husband Prince Harry have taken legal action against several media publications, alleging invasion of privacy. AFP/Tolga Akmen LOS ANGELES - Meghan Markle suggested Buckingham Palace was "perpetuating falsehoods" about her and her husband Prince Harry, in a clip from an upcoming interview with US chat show host Oprah Winfrey released by CBS. Asked by Winfrey how she felt about the Palace hearing her speak out, Markle replied: "I don't know how they could expect that after all of this time we would still just be silent if there's an active role that The Firm is playing in perpetuating falsehoods about us." “There’s a lot that’s been lost already.”

"We are clearly very concerned about allegations in The Times following claims made by former staff of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex... our HR team will look into the circumstances," Buckingham Palace said in a statement earlier on Wednesday.

Markle had released a statement directly addressing the report earlier. "The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself," her spokesman said.
