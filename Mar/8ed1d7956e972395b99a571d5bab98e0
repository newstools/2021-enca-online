Wits SRC president Mpendulo Mfeka said on Monday: "She's critical, I can only hope she's stable. She was taken to Milpark Hospital. "From my observation, that wasn't a rubber bullet because it went right through. It went from behind the knee through the front and we have about five of our fellow students who have been arrested.

"I'm hoping that it was rubber bullets that were fired. It's saddening that not longer than a week ago there was the case of Mthokozisi Ntumba, a civilian who was shot dead using rubber bullets. "This time there wasn't even a warning shot. People were shot at, she happens to be a casualty and I hope she will be able to walk again."
