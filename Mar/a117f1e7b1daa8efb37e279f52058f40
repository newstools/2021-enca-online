She had been in hospital on a ventilator fighting the virus. My thoughts with her family and her colleagues. May her memory be for a blessing. #KarimaBrown I know many people have different stories of Karima Brown- but I have experienced her on a different level, seeing her fight for her producers, fight for them to get paid right. Her passing comes as a shock and I pray for her family during this time.
