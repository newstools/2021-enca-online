The Former Transnet Chief Financial Officer will be delivering evidence related to the state-owned enterprise. Various witnesses have told the inquiry that Singh was involved in dubious dealings at both Transnet and Eskom. The SA Institute of Chartered Accountants revoked his membership after finding him guilty on 12 charges.

Singh was unable to appear earlier this month due to his wife giving birth. Last year Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo agreed to grant him a postponement due to a flaw in the summons issued requiring him to give evidence.
