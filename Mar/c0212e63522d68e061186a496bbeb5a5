File: A house key. Pixabay/TierraMallorca JOHANNESBURG - There has been a recovery in the number of tenants meeting their rental obligations. This is according to the latest data from credit bureau TPN, which shows payment performance continued to recover in the fourth quarter of 2020. This after the harsh financial impact of the second quarter's hard lockdown. READ: Landlords issue more eviction notices While rental payments are still falling behind the pre-lockdown levels seen at the start of last year, tenants in good standing with their landlords increased to 61 percent from 50.36 percent in the second quarter of 2020. Data up to December also shows a continued recovery in tenant payments in the poorly performing retail property sector. But, the office and industrial property sectors' tenant payment performances did not improve much and that's not set to change in 2021.
