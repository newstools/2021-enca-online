AFP/Ben Stansall LONDON - Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip was making slight progress after being admitted to hospital more than two weeks ago, his daughter-in-law said. Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, said the 99-year-old Duke of Edinburgh, who was moved to a specialist unit for heart tests on Monday, was "slightly improving". While visiting a vaccination centre in London, she said he "hurts at moments", responding to a question from a volunteer there.

Philip's current stay in hospital is now his longest ever, raising fears for his health because of his advanced age. The prince was first admitted to the private King Edward VII Hospital in central London on 16 February. Buckingham Palace said initially that he was expected to stay there for a "few days" after walking in unaided.
