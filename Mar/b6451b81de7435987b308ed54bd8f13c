JOHANNESBURG - The ANC is briefing the media on developments within the party. The Constitutional Court has reserved judgment on whether former president Jacob Zuma should be jailed for contempt of court.
This over his continued failure to appear at the state capture inquiry.
The court heard an urgent application from the commission on Thursday morning. The party on Thursday said it would hold a regular meeting of its National Executive Committee from Friday to Sunday. Key issues to be discussed include COVID-19 response and vaccine rollout, local government elections, tertiary education funding and the terms of reference for the ANC Integrity Commission.
