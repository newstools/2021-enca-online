Winning start for Lewis Hamilton SAKHIR - Lewis Hamilton got his bid for an eighth world title off to a thrilling start with victory in the Bahrain Grand Prix on Sunday. Mercedes star Hamilton edged out pole-sitter Max Verstappen in his Red Bull, with Valtteri Bottas in the second Mercedes rounding out the podium. "What a difficult race that was.
