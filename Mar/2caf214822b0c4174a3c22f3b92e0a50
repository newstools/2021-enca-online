AFP/Rodger Bosch DOHA - Roger Federer said retirement was never an option during his battle with injury, insisting Sunday the recovery from knee surgery was "completely under control" ahead of his return to competitive tennis at this week's Qatar Open. The 39-year-old hasn't played a match since a semi-final defeat by Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open in January 2020 and acknowledged it was unusual for a player of his age to return after injury. "I know it's on the rare side for a 40-year-old to come back after a year out," he said at a media briefing in the Qatari capital Doha.

Federer, who underwent two knee surgeries in 2020, added: "The important thing is I'm pain-free and injury-free. "I'm very happy to be back playing a tournament -- I never thought it was going to take this long."

"Obviously I'm confident otherwise I wouldn't put myself in this situation," he said ahead of his first match which will be on either Tuesday or Wednesday. "In a vision, I see myself with the trophy," he said.

"It's still building up to being fitter, better, faster," he said. "I'll see about Dubai (the week after Doha)... then we'll see about the clay-court season."
