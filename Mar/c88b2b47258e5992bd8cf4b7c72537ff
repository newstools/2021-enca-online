Officials fear that an influx of overseas visitors for the Games will endanger the Japanese public. AFP/Philip Fong TOKYO - Overseas spectators are likely to be shut out from the Tokyo Olympics, Japanese media reported, after organisers said that public safety would be the "top priority" at the coronavirus-delayed Games. The Japanese government, Tokyo metropolitan government and Tokyo 2020 organising committee are leaning towards holding the massive event in front of a domestic audience only, the Yomiuri Shimbun and other outlets said.

The three parties met with International Olympic and Paralympic Committee heads on Wednesday and agreed to take a decision on spectators by the end of the month, ideally before the nationwide torch relay begins on March 25. But comments made by organisers before and after the talks hinted that overseas fans will be locked out, with games president Seiko Hashimoto saying public safety is the "top priority".

Reports said Japanese organisers will soon make their position official and convey it to IOC and IPC chiefs. Bach said last week that a decision on overseas fans would be taken in late April or early May, but Hashimoto said Wednesday that fans, hotels and travel operators needed to know sooner. Around 900,000 tickets have reportedly already been sold outside Japan.
