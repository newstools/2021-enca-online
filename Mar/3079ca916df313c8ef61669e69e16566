A mere R13 an hour is what workers say they're getting paid. They are demanding a R21 per hour and a 10 percent increase. Waste management worker Neliswa Dyakobi said, "if we lose our jobs, there's nothing we will gain out of it. We are not receiving any benefits, not even a provident fund, They even told us we will leave with nothing." Management says it will only negotiate with their union and only if its representatives are prepared to resolve the matter. Unions say they've been at loggerheads with the management for several years.

Management has refuted the claims. They say are doing their best to preserve jobs during these difficult economic times. Waste management director Rob Parker said, "from our side, we will try and increase their wages but obviously we can only do with what we have. I think another point that I just want to bring in here is that the Kraaifontein project is not currently making any profit." In the meantime, many clients have had to find an alternative waste-management facility.
