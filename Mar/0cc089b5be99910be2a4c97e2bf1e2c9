Jake White's team scored five tries in the closely contested North-South derby. But they were let off the hook by the visitors. Well past the hooter, the Stormers kicked for the corner to set up a line-out. Eighth man Juarno Augustus had a great opportunity to win the match for his side but lost control of the ball. It was a costly mistake as the Bulls hung on to take the match 34-29.
