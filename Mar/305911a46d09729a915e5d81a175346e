A host of golfers at the World Golf Championships Workday Championship in Bradenton, Florida -- and quite a few at the LPGA Tour event in Orlando, as well -- took the course for their final rounds wearing Woods's signature Sunday colours of red and black.

"Obviously things are looking a little better today than they were on Tuesday, but he's still got aways to go. "He's got a huge recovery ahead of him.

Tiger Woods, here celebrating his 15th major championship at the 2019 Masters, said he was touched to see golfers wear red and black to offer support as he recovers from serious leg injuries sustained in a car crash "If there was no Tiger Woods, I just think the tour and the game of golf, in general, would be in a worse place. "He's meant a lot to us, he still does mean a lot to us and I think that was just a little way to show that." Collin Morikawa lifted the trophy at Concession Golf Club in Bradenton, becoming joining Woods as the only players to win both a major title and a WGC crown before turning 25. - Thank you, Tiger - "Tiger means everything to me," Morikawa said. "Yes, he had the crash and thankfully he's okay and will make a quick recovery. "But I don't think we say thank you enough, so I want to say thank you to Tiger."
