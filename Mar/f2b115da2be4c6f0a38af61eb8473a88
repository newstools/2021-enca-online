Mick, son of seven-time world champion Michael, will drive for US team Haas in the season-opening Bahrain Grand Prix. Schumacher (22) earned his chance by winning the Formula Three European championship in 2018 and the Formula Two title in 2020. His famous name has helped make it easier for Haas to find funding, but the young German's longer-term career plan seems clear.

"The name Schumacher is a brand, but it is a brand linked to the first name Michael," Herve Bodinier, a sports marketing professional and Formula 1 expert, told AFP.
