Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane. AFP/Phill Magakoe JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane may soon have to fight for her job. This follows findings by the Independent Review Panel that Parliament has a prima facie case against her. READ: Mkhwebane: I am being attacked from every quarter National Assembly Speaker Thandi Modise appointed the panel to conduct a preliminary assessment, and to determine whether there is prima facie evidence, showing misconduct or that Mkhwebane is incompetent. The DA brought a motion to have Mkhwebane impeached last year due, to several court judgments made against her and some of her reports. The public protector would be the first head of a Chapter 9 institution to be impeached.
