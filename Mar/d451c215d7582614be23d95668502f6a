Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Rubber bullets are here to stay but Police Minister Bheki Cele says police will be better trained in how and when to use them. The minister was releasing a report looking into policing and crowd control. "It’s a standard operation that we are looking at. We have looked around, we've had more input from other organisations. We are not looking at cutting off and stopping it. I know that that call has been made," Cele said.

Things like distance: Where should you use rubber bullets, are you [police officers] using them directly, you should shoot down... these rubber bullets should be for scaring people off rather than hurting people." Close to R600-million has been used to better equip the Public Order Policing units. Cele said this is according to a recommendation by a panel of experts.
