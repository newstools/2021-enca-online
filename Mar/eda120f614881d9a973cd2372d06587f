The motive behind the killings of six people in Beacon Valley and Tafelsig last week, is still unknown. The youngest victim of the shootings, 13-year-old Tamir Mitchell, has been laid to rest. Some community members are speculating the deadly shooting on the 25th of February in Beacon Valley may be gang-related. "I have lived this live, I know what is happening here," says activist, Fadiel Adams.

I do believe that it is gang-related it's just the fact that they shot the wrong people," he adds Police are yet to make any arrests. Many Cape Flats residents say they've lost faith in government. "I am urging all politicians don't come when the body or the blood is already flowing down the streets. What is your plan prior to that? We want preventative measures we don't want things to happen when the person is already deceased," says Lynn Phillips, the Cape Flats Forum secretary.
 
Mitchell was among the two who died in a hail of bullets in Beacon Bay.
