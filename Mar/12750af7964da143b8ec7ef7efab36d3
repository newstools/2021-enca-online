Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The ANC supports the state capture inquiry and wants attacks on the judiciary to stop. The late-night National Executive Committee statement affirmed this position but stopped short of directly naming former president Jacob Zuma. He continues to defy court orders and launches regular attacks on the inquiry and the courts.

Political analyst Prince Mashele said his expectation is that Zuma is going to be jailed. "He has shown the middle finger to the judiciary and the judges at the Constitutional Court are human beings. I’m sure they would want to teach him a lesson to demonstrate to society that there is no one who is above the law." READ: Zuma contempt matter reserved ANC spokesperson Pule Mabe said: “We have also urged our members to desist from attacking the judiciary. The ANC supports the judiciary and its independence.” Mashele says there is a method in the madness of not directly naming Zuma. “They are not naming him in order to include a whole grouping of rogues in the ANC who think and behave like him," He said.
