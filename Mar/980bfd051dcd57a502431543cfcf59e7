According to Nxumalo, there is a code of conduct for inmates. "This particular inmate is doing a life sentence, but he had been classified as a medium," says Nxumalo. "One of the things that will happen, the inmate will get reclassified, meaning going back into a maximum category." There are many privileges that the inmate will lose, says Nxumalo. He says they are looking to get a hold of the cellphone used to record the incident. Watch the video above for more on this story.
