The net-zero carbon house was designed by a group of young professionals who graduated from Stellenbosch University and the University of Cape Town. It only took two weeks for construction. eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana has the story. Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - Ever wondered what a net-zero carbon home looks like? Well, a group of nine young professionals has built a 100 percent solar-powered house using recyclable items. Their design won at the Cape Town Future Energy Festival 2020. Everything is recyclable -- from the material used to build a bed, electricity and even water used for flushing the toilet. The City of Cape Town says through its collaboration with the Green Building Council South Africa, the project was opened to students and professionals who were asked to think about future housing designs. For now, this house will be used as an exhibit to show people what going green looks like. * eNCA’s Nobesuthu Hejana reports.
