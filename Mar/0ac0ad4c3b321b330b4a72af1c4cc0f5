The troubled SOE says it's in constant communication with property owners to come to an agreement and re-open these branches as soon as possible. The postal service said its revenue has increased after a difficult COVID-19 lockdown period and this will help it to address creditor backlogs.

The DA's shadow deputy minister of communications and digital technologies, Cameron MacKenzie said: "After R8-billion in bailouts over the last seven years, you'd think the Post Office would be in a financially sustainable position. "We heard before the committee that the net loss, up until September 2020 was R429-million. The government in its latest budget has only allocated R500-million, so the allocation for the year barely covers the loss of one quarter."
