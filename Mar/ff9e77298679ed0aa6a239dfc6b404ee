Cathay Pacific warned of a tough road ahead after reporting a record loss for 2020. AFP/Anthony Wallace HONG KONG - Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific said it suffered a record $2.8-billion loss last year as the coronavirus pandemic wiped out demand for travel -- and the airline warned of a long road to recovery ahead. Chairman Patrick Healy described 2020 as the "most challenging" in the airline's 70-year history and said much will now depend on how effective and widespread global vaccination programmes are. "It is by no means clear how the pandemic and its impact will develop over the coming months," he warned, saying the group expected passenger traffic to remain "well below" half of pre-pandemic levels throughout 2021.

The airline also found itself punished by authorities in Beijing because some of its employees joined or voiced support for the protests.
