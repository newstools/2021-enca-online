AFP/Ludovic Marin PARIS - A third of France's population was under a new partial lockdown on Saturday to stop the spread of COVID-19. Parisians packed trains leaving the capital and crammed into shops ahead of the new restrictions coming into force. The government has insisted the new month-long lockdown will be more limited than two others imposed last year, with schools open and outdoor exercise allowed for an unlimited amount of time.

"What we want is to put a brake on the virus without shutting ourselves in. This is not being locked down," he said at a meeting at the Elysee Palace. "Strictly speaking, the term lockdown is not right," he added.

The other regions affected by the new measures include the Hauts-de-France region of northeast France which covers the city of Lille and the Alpes-Maritimes on the Mediterranean, as well as Seine-Maritime and the Eure in Normandy. The other two COVID-19 hotspots -- around the southern Mediterranean town of Nice, and the northern region surrounding Calais -- have been under weekend lockdowns since late February and early March respectively. The whole country has lived under a 6pm curfew since 14 January.
