Segal, who was nominated for an Oscar for the 1966 drama "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?", died in Santa Rosa, California of complications from bypass surgery, his wife told the Hollywood news publication Deadline on Tuesday. While younger viewers may know him as grandfather Albert "Pops" Solomon in the ABC network TV series "The Goldbergs," his long film career included starring roles in "The Duchess and the Dirtwater Fox" (1976) with Goldie Hawn, and "Fun With Dick and Jane" (1977) with Jane Fonda. "We are deeply saddened to learn of the passing of George Segal," Sony Pictures Television -- which produces "The Goldbergs" -- said in a statement. "He was a true icon and legend in this business and an integral member of our Sony family." Born 17 February 1934 in a small town in the state of New York, Segal studied acting and had early roles in Broadway theater productions. His first major Hollywood role was in "The Young Doctors" (1961), and later in "The Longest Day" (1962) about the allied landing in Normandy during World War II. In "Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolf?" he played a young professor alongside two megastars of the time, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Segal won a Golden Globe award for his role in "A Touch of Class" (1973) with Glenda Jackson. On TV Segal was known for his roles in shows such as the NBC sitcom "Just Shoot Me!" (1997-2003), and later "The Goldbergs," which began its run in 2013 and is still in production.
