Egypt's Suez Canal Authority said it was working to refloat the MV Ever Given. AFP CAIRO - Tug boats worked on Wednesday to free a giant container ship stuck in the Suez Canal after it veered off course in a sandstorm, creating huge tailbacks on one of the world's busiest trade routes. Egypt's Suez Canal Authority said it was doing all it could to refloat the Taiwan-run but Panama-flagged MV Ever Given, a 400-metre long and 59-metre wide vessel, which was lodged at an angle across the waterway. Historic sections of the canal have been reopened in a bid to ease the bottleneck of backed up marine traffic, with dozens of ships waiting on both the Mediterranean and Red Sea sides. The SCA said the ship was caught up in a gale-force sandstorm, a common occurence in Egypt's Sinai desert at this time of year, which blotted out light and limited the captain's ability to see. It was "mainly due to the lack of visibility due to the weather conditions when winds reached 40 knots, which affected the control" of the ship, the SCA said in a statement. Ship operator Evergreen Marine Corp told AFP that the Rotterdam-bound vessel "ran aground after a suspected gust of wind hit it". Storms with dense dust clouds carrying fine sand have swept across much of the Middle East since Tuesday. Container ships account for more than half of the canal's total traffic, with some of them being among the largest in the world. Most of the cargo travelling from the Gulf to Western Europe is oil. In the opposite direction, it is mostly manufactured goods and grain from Europe and North America headed to the Middle East and Asia.
