Similar areas are planned at Universal Studios parks in Orlando and Hollywood. AFP/Philip Fong TOKYO - Here we go! After months of pandemic delays, Nintendo's first-ever theme park, featuring a "Mario Kart" ride in a real-life Bowser's Castle, opened in Japan on Thursday to delighted fans. The attraction, whose bright, block-like surroundings are straight out of the classic "Super Mario" games, is part of the existing Universal Studios Japan amusement park in the western city of Osaka. "We perfectly recreated the world of the game.... You'll find life-sized piranha plants and Bowser, and you'll see what it is like to be Mario," said Ayumu Yamamoto, USJ's marketing communication manager.

Its launch was pushed back to February and then delayed again as Japan's government declared a state of emergency in early 2021 to curb spiking cases. Similar areas are planned at Universal Studios parks in Orlando and Hollywood. AFP/Philip Fong Music from the popular Mario games plays throughout the park and a smartphone-linked wristband allows visitors to collect virtual coins by punching blocks, just like the Italian plumber. Augmented reality goggles attached to a plastic red visor are used in the "Mario Kart" ride, one of the park's main draws that promises to bring the racing game to life. The zone also boasts a ride based on the cute green dinosaur Yoshi, a Peach's castle, Mario-themed restaurants and lifesize characters from the Mushroom Kingdom. Fans told AFP they were thrilled about the much-anticipated opening of the park, which cost more than $550-million, according to USJ.
