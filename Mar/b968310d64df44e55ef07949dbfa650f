Courtesy of #DStv403 EMFULENI - Gauteng Premier David Makhura says his office is working hard on fixing governance problems in the Sedibeng District. Makhura says the Emfuleni Municipality, the biggest in the region, is the cause of the problems. Emfuleni is currently under administration. READ:Â It will take years to fix Emfuleni's problems, says administrator Makhura said, "the Emfuleni Municipality is not doing its job. When you go into the townships it is visible. It is dirty. People just throw away their rubbish everywhere because the municipality is not collecting refuse." "That is something that must be done every week but the Emfuleni municipality is not doing that. It is as simple as that. The roads are in a bad state. So we've got a big problem." "Waste removal is something basic for every municipality. If you can't deal with basic things like collecting refuse then it means you can't solve big problems like the economy."
