Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa's innings remain on a sticky wicket. The organisation's interim board and members' council are still not seeing eye-to-eye on significant matters. This time, the composition of the board is in question. READ:Â Cricket SA: Members' Council rejects proposed changes According to the interim board, the members' council has rejected the proposal of a board made up largely of independents. This board structure is part of the recommendations of the Nicholson report. It was also supported by a governance specialist hired by CSA's interim board to look into the organisation's affairs. Eight of 14 members' council members rejected the call for more independent directors. As a result, the interim board says it will request the members' council to disclose which way the voting went. This latest matter is one more in months of controversy that have embroiled CSA over its governance failures. A media briefing that was set for Thursday was postponed as the tension between the two parties unfolded. The interim board now says they expect that a briefing will be held with the Sports Minister in attendance.
