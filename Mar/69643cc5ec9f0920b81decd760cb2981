JOHANNESBURG - The Reserve Bank kept the repo rate unchanged at 3,5 percent on Thursday after cutting rates aggressively last year to shore up the economy.
The prime lending rate at banks has been at a level of 7 percent since July last year. This followed a cumulative 300 basis points reduction in support of the pandemic-hit economy. READ: Markets hit by rate hike fears The bank largely considers the inflation trend when deciding on interest rates. Lower inflation supports the case for either cutting interest rates or keeping them steady. Although inflation came in at 2,9 percent, there are risks that prices may rise because of increasing fuel and electricity tariffs. While analysts believe the rate will go up early next year, some believe it could happen sooner.
