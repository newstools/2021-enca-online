Community members along with municipal officials united in a march to Eskom’s headquarters in Johannesburg on Monday. They delivered a memorandum to express their concerns. READ: Emfuleni property attached over Eskom debt They've accused Eskom of not keeping to a previous agreement with residents. The Public Works MMC said there was an arrangement with Eskom that people who owed the power utility money would pay what they could, in exchange for keeping the light on. But he says Eskom has done a u-turn. READ: Rand Water owed R1,3-billion by Emfuleni Municipality The municipality itself owes billions in unpaid electricity bills to Eskom. Bhekumuzi Ntsele, Emfuleni Public Works MMC said: “They should be replacing the transformers, now they are going into transformers that are still working and disconnecting people because they are saying those people are not paying. We are saying, you can't do that without consulting your customers, without consulting the governers of those wards.” Despite only a small number of residents showing up to the march, their leaders have called this a revolution. Eskom has been given 14 days to respond to residents’ concerns.
