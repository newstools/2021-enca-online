AFP/Frazer Harrison PARIS - Gamers are used to taking control of Neymar in virtual football pitches, but the Brazilian star has found a new field to run wild on: the shoot'em up mega-hit "Fortnite". Neymar's recruitment is part of a strategy by Epic Games to expand the universe of "Fortnite" beyond its kill-or-be-killed "Battle Royale" by wheeling in the sports, music and film worlds. The footballer follows in the footsteps of US rapper Travis Scott, whose avatar performed five virtual concerts on "Fortnite" last year seen by 12 million players.

Users have been able to put the kits of football teams such as Manchester City and Juventus on their avatars since the start of the year, but Neymar is the first athlete with an unlockable "player skin". Neymar's selection made sense because the footballer is a fan of the game -- he streams himself playing "Fortnite" live on Twitch -- and has nearly 150 million Instagram followers.
