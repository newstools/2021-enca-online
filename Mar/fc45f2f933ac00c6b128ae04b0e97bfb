Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane in the dock at the Pretoria magistrate's court. eNCA/Govan Whittles JOHANNESBURG - Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane has lost another case. Her report against former Finance Minister Des van Rooyen has been reviewed and set aside. READ: Mkhwebane's perjury case postponed The North Gauteng High Court found Mkhwebane erred in reporting in 2018 report that Van Rooyen misled Parliament when answering a question on whether he had met with the Guptas "after taking office". It found Mkhwebane was wrong to conclude that the question included the period "in the runup" to his appointment in December 2015 or "any meetings ever" with the Guptas.
