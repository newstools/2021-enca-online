The eThekwini municipality looks after the Kings Park sporting precinct, including the swimming pool. The venue will not stage the national championships and Olympic qualifiers this year because of a leaking roof despite repairs six years ago. eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga reports. Courtesy of #DStv403 DURBAN - The Kings Park pool has been the home of the South African national swimming championships for the past 28 years. But in an Olympic year, the venue is not good enough to play host to any event. This has forced Swimming South Africa to find an alternative. The eThekwini municipality looks after the Kings Park sporting precinct, including the swimming pool. eThekwini Municipality communication manager Mandla Nsele said: "I can confirm that the City is aware of the leak of the roof of the swimming pool, the leak is due to the damage which was caused by the recent storms that the city experienced.

All the relevant municipality departments responsible for the maintenance of the stadium are finalising the process there is an insurance process that is currently underway. I must also indicate that the swimming pool is functional at the moment but it's not fully functional because of the roof."
The National Championships are set to take place in April, and the pool will not be ready in time. Swimming South Africa has already issued a schedule for next month's qualifiers, with the Newton Stadium in Port Elizabeth as their preferred alternative. * eNCA's Siphokazi Malinga reports.
