The Monarch's Prime Minister, Prince Mangosuthu Buthulezi, isn't happy about the way he claims he's being treated by the royal house. READ: Royal Family decides King Goodwill Zwelithini will not lie in state "As you know, big families have a lot of drama. We had decided that things will be done in a certain way. But in no time I heard that some in the family went and did exactly the opposite. I'd asked that the king's body be embalmed, but I heard they went behind my back saying it must not be done. We know the king passed away due to COVID-19 complications and how dangerous it is if the body is not treated carefully. They decided without my knowledge to take the body to all his palaces. The job I'm doing is very painful. This is why I cry because I take unnecessary hits. I called ministers Zweli Mkhize and Bheki Cele to stop this fire. I didn't want to come back here because of this disrespect," said Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, PM to the Mornach. King Zwelithini passed away on Friday morning after a long battle with diabetes. President Cyril Ramaphosa has accorded him a special official funeral, category 1. The funeral date has yet to be announced.
