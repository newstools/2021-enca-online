 Every clinic in the Kingdom of Eswatini now has one of these solar-powered water heating stations. 92 units have been built over the last five months as a donation to the country. Before entering health facilities, patients and staff wash their hands with clean, hot running water - a luxury most residents living in rural areas don't even have at home.

An energy group has installed solar-powered water heating stations at all state clinics in the country. Before these units, about 82 percent of these facilities didn't have any hot water, a sanitation and hygiene challenge exacerbated by the pandemic.

"One of the priorities was to build the clinics first because you can’t put the staff here without the clinics," said Themba Masuku, Eswatini's acting prime minister. "As we were building the clinics, we have 92 of them now, these public health facilities, the stakeholders came in and wanted to assist. We gladly accepted that, so everything is prioritised. Health is one of our major priorities.” eNCA's Monique Mortlock reports.
