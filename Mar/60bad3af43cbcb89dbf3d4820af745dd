The Academy Awards have been delayed to their latest-ever date, while several big-screen studio blockbusters skipped their 2020 releases entirely. AFP/Robyn Beck LOS ANGELES - No Zoom speeches, no jeans, and a returning veteran director: this year's pandemic-hit Oscars ceremony started to take shape on Friday. The show on April 25, which will conclude a much-delayed Hollywood awards season, is taking place in Los Angeles with extensive COVID-19 testing precautions for nominees and their guests.

"Our plan is that this year's Oscars will look like a movie, not a television show, and Glenn has embraced this approach and come up with ideas of his own on how to achieve this," Soderbergh and his fellow producers said in a statement.

This year's Oscars were delayed by eight weeks after COVID-19 shuttered movie theatres, upended Hollywood's release calendar and placed live events on indefinite hold last spring.
