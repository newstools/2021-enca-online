Over 40 families were left homeless after illegally occupying RDP houses in the township. But, the City of Ekurhuleni believes they’re anything but helpless. Residents say they have little choice but to sleep here out in the cold. They were evicted by the municipality for illegally occupying RDP houses. They claim they did this in September last year after being overlooked for housing by the municipality. Now, they have nowhere to go. Residents accuse the City of Ekurhuleni of corruption in the allocation of housing. An RDP house occupant backs this up, saying she paid R70,000 for her home. But the City is unmoved, and says it was acting well within the law by removing the residents. They says a criminal syndicate is also operating in the area. Meanwhile, the residents say they’ll remain here until the municipality gives them alternate accommodation. 
They now want to approach the Human Rights Commission to intervene.
