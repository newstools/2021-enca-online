The court awarded applicants e.tv and Telkom the interdict against Icasa. JOHANNESBURG -Â The High Court has ordered the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa to halt the planned auction of radio frequency spectrum licences. The court awarded applicants e.tv and Telkom the interdict against Icasa. The order handed down by the Pretoria court today bars Icasa from assessing or adjudicating any applications received under its invitation to apply to the spectrum auction. The auction was set to take place by the end of this month. e.tv joined Telkom's application, arguing in court papers that the auction process was irrational by design. Icasa opposed the urgent court challenge. In a media statement in January, Icasa stated that South Africans deserve all the benefits of licensing the spectrum.
