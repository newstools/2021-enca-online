Their attorney argued in the magistrate’s court in Malawi that Chirwa was biased.

Bushiri and his wife are wanted in South Africa on money laundering, theft and fraud charges.

The state objected to the application. "There’s a ruling coming on Monday to that effect, however, I want to maintain that it’s a criminal matter, they are arguing that it’s a civil matter," said Malawi's director of public prosecutions, Steve Kayuni.

The matter has been postponed to next Monday.
