Lewis Hamilton is aiming to win an eighth world title to overtake Michael Schumacher. AFP/Pool LONDON - Lewis Hamilton said that winning a record-breaking eighth world championship in 2021 would not be the determining factor in whether he quits after the season. The attempt to land a drivers' crown that would move the 36-year-old Briton above Michael Schumacher to become the most decorated driver in the sport's history will go hand-in-hand with the issue of his future in Formula One. "I've made a really important decision in my mind, that I don't want that to be the deciding factor," Hamilton said in a conference call at the launch of the Mercedes car for 2021.

If all you're going for is accolades, if all you're going for is titles, I feel like you could potentially lose your way. "Of course it's the ultimate dream, but I don't think that's necessarily going to be the deciding factor whether to stay or keep going." Hamilton denied that a one-year extension to his contract had increased the possibility that the upcoming season could be his final one in the sport.

"We are living in an unusual period of time. I just wanted one year, then we can talk about if we do more and keep adding to it by one if we have to." Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff insisted that despite seven successive constructors' titles the team had the "same fire, hunger and passion" as when he arrived in 2013.

It will be seen on the track for the first time in pre-season testing in Bahrain on March 12. The season-opening Grand Prix takes place on March 28. "Every year we reset our focus and define the right objectives," said Wolff in a statement to mark the launch of the new car.

"So many things can happen and it's very natural to get used to success, and therefore not fight as hard for it. But this team has not shown any of that." Wolff said Hamilton and Finnish team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who underlined Mercedes' dominance by finishing second in the 2020 drivers' standings, always have new challenges which keep them motivated.
