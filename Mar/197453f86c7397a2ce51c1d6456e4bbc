They were arrested in October last year in connection with the 2014 killing.

Advocate Gerrie Nel, Head of AfriForum's Private Prosecution Unit, said he is disappointed that further arrests have not been made. "I really expected the mastermind to be arrested by today. In October last year we indicated we thought there's enough evidence to arrest the mastermind, even then."
