"Street Scene in Montmartre" -- on public display for the first time since its creation in 1887, after a century in the same collection -- fetched 13.09 million euros. AFP/Stephane de Sakutin PARIS - One of the few paintings by Vincent Van Gogh still in private hands sold for more than 13 million euros at auction, Sotheby's said. "Street Scene in Montmartre" -- on public display for the first time since its creation in 1887, after a century in the same collection -- fetched 13.09 million euros, the auction house said. At well above the estimate of 5-8 million euros, the sale price was a record for the artist in France, it added. The 1887 Van Gogh, one of more than 200 paintings produced by the Dutch post-Impressionist master during two years spent in Paris, portrays one of the windmills that dotted Montmartre when it was just a village on the northern outskirts of the capital.

The period marked a turning point in Van Gogh's career as he began exploring expressionist techniques and new uses of colour in the final years of his life, before his suicide in 1890 at the age of 37. It is not considered one of his best works.
