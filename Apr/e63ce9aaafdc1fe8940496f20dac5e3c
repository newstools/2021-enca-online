The change enables users to control and prioritise on what Facebook calls its "News Feed," or the main element seen when people log onto Facebook. This will allow people to see more from their friends and contacts, and enable users to turn off the Facebook algorithm entirely and see posts in chronological order if they choose.

Clegg said algorithms are largely driven by the user.

Instead, there are billions of front pages, each personalised to our individual tastes and preferences."
