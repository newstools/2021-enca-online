Michael Kiwanuka is among artists slated to perform from well-known stages around Worthy Farm. AFP/Noam Galai LONDON - Britain's Glastonbury Festival announced a livestream concert in May at its famous southwest English farm site, after the pandemic led to the blockbuster event's cancellation for the second consecutive summer. The five-hour ticketed virtual show on 22 May will include performances by artists like Coldplay, Wolf Alice and Michael Kiwanuka from well-known stages around Worthy Farm, including the Stone Circle and Pyramid field. Organiser Emily Eavis, who announced in January that the annual event was cancelled for the second year in a row, said it would be "like the festival but without people". "We're going to take you on a journey through all of those spots that you know, you recognise from Worthy Farm," she told BBC radio. "We're very excited to be able to show the farm in a way that people have never really seen it, with these incredible artists." Tickets for the global livestream event, which will be broadcast across four separate time zones, will cost £20, with Eavis adding there will be "a number of unannounced surprise performances". It will be interspersed by a spoken word narrative, "written and delivered by some very special guests, guiding festival-goers on a journey through the sacred valley in Somerset", according to the official Glastonbury website. The festival, held on a dairy farm in Somerset, southwest England, was forced to cancel in 2020 -- the year of the event's 50th anniversary -- because of coronavirus restrictions after some 135,000 people had bought tickets.
