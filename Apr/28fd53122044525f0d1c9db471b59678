The GT Series will open opportunities for talented South African drivers, to achieve international recognition. Tshepo Thobane reports. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - All over the world, it’s a well-known fact that motorsport is expensive to practice. Here in South Africa, the GT Racing Association aims to change that. The recently launched racing series is designed to position local motorsport at the pinnacle, without excluding the disadvantaged. The association will put on a big show on 22 May at the historic ST George’s Grand Prix circuit in East London. * eNCA's Tshepo Thobane reports.
