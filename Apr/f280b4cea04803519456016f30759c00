The town in the Cabo Delgado province was attacked by Islamic militants. Dozens of people died and those who could not escape are trapped there without food and other supplies. Wesley Nel, his brother Adrian, and his dad Greg Knox were trapped in the Amarula Hotel without food for three days and without any weapons to protect themselves.

"We trying to raise the money to keep them in the schools and would also like to send them to university both me and my brother never got the opportunity and that was the one thing he was really strong about was his kids gotta go to university." Nel estimates about 25,000 people are still in Palma without supplies, and he wants to help them.
