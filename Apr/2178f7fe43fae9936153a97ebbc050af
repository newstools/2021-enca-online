South Africa may have sold off its stock of the Astrazeneca COVID-19 vaccine, after it proved less effective against mild to moderate cases of the variant of the virus that is dominant here. But concerns around a higher risk of blood clotting continue to raise questions not only around the safety of this vaccine but generally. #eNCA​ Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - The benefits of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine far outweigh the risks,  according to Wits University Vaccinology Professor Shabir Madhi. He says that almost every vaccine has minor side effects. Several European countries have halted its use over fears the vaccine is causing blood clots. "This is very likely to be the case where anti-vaxxers will leverage on this particular example that vaccines aren't safe and haven't gone through adequate scientific interrogation, which is not true," says Madhi. "Other vaccines that are used also have extremely rare side-effects in a magnitude of one in a million," he adds.
