Tinkler says he feels bad for recently fired Molefi Ntseki, saying problems at Bafana Bafana are beyond a coach. "As a coach, I know it's very difficult," says Tinkler. READ: Molefi Ntseki fired as Bafana Bafana coach "We always take the blame and that's the harsh reality of the professional game and we accept that," he adds. However, with Bafana Bafana having had 19 coaches in 15 years, Tinkler believes there are deeper problems that need to be resolved. Ntseki failed to qualify South Africa for the 2022 Afcon tournament in Cameroon. Bafana lost 2-0 to Sudan in their last Afcon qualifier. Ntseki took over from Stuart Baxter in 2019.
