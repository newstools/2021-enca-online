Former Mineral Resources Minister Mosebenzi Zwane. JOHANNESBURG - Former Minister of Minerals, Mosebenzi Zwane, says his 2015  trip to Switzerland was solely to avoid a jobs bloodbath. Zwane met with Glencore boss, Ivan Glasenberg and Gupta associate, Salim Essa, allegedly to help facilitate the sale of Optimum mine to Gupta-owned Tegeta. He denies putting pressure on them. He also denies that he named Essa as his advisor. Zwane testified at the State Capture Commission of Inquiry on Tuesday.

Zwane says he was prepared to take any solution that would have saved jobs.
