The trade union also says some businesses might not be able to survive this. READ: Eskom gets go-ahead for tariff increase Eskom is hiking electricity by over 15 percent after the North Gauteng High Court granted the power utility permission to raise electricity prices. This will see Eskom recover R10-billion from customers. Cosatu's Bheki Ntshalintshali said, "any tariff increase will squeeze the small economy, businesses will go out of business, workers will be retrenched. People will revert to some unhealthy resources using woods, paraffin." "We may see an increase of fires in the squatter camps, so it's a very sad story indeed."
