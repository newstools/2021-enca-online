Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Tshegofatso Pule's family says they are frustrated and want the bail application to conclude so that the wheels of justice can finally start turning. Pule's former lover Ntuthuko Shoba has applied for bail for a second time at the Roodepoort Magistrate's Court. His defence team says he deserves bail because he is been cooperating with police and is not a flight risk. The convicted hitman in the case has fingered Shoba as the alleged mastermind in the killing of Pule.

"We are ready for this to just end and for trail to begin and we are ready to move on to High Court," says Modisane. Modisane says there is an utter disrespect and disregard towards Pule's friends and family. Judgement for Shoba's bail application has been set for 7 May.
