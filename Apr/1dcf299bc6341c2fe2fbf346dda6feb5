SAUS president Misheck Mugabe said the union works from a mandate of university SRCs. "I can tell you, we met on 30 March, and we discussed developments regarding the shutdown. When we called for a shutdown, we were not happy about what was happening where students were facing massive financial exclusion.

"So we were not happy, and that's why we called for a shutdown. Now, we came back with a report to the SRCs to say that these are the developments since we started with the shutdown. There was a unanimous agreement from all the 26 universities' SRCs to say let's call off the shutdown because all our students are now having access to universities."
