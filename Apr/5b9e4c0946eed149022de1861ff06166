Thousands of motorists are expected to make the journey home from their long weekend holiday destinations on Sunday. With the long Easter weekend drawing to a close, holidaymakers are preparing to head back to their various destinations. People were unable to travel last year because the country's lockdown restrictions prohibited interprovincial travel but this year under lockdown alert level 1, traveling is permitted. Courtesy #DStv403 Close to 300 people have been arrested for being intoxicated on the roads since the beginning of the long weekend. "Seemingly, some people think that they can get away with it and that the law does not apply to them. We want to urge them that the laws apply to everybody," says spokesperson, Simon Zwane.
