The Gauteng traffic police department has so far recorded at least 11 deaths since the beginning of the Easter weekend. These are just preliminary Easter statistics, perhaps to get the latest figures let's bring in Gauteng Traffic Police spokesperson Sello Maremane. #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Gauteng traffic police spokesperson Sello Maremane is urging motorists to exercise caution. The warning comes as traffic continues to increase on major routes as travellers hit the road for Easter long weekend. READ: High traffic expected over Easter weekend Maremane said, "from the N1 freeway from Pretoria to Polokwane, we were able to record 3,000 vehicles passing through the tollgate. On the N3 over 2,500 heading towards Durban." "All major routes leading and leaving our province have been very much busy." "So we're appealing to our road users, be it pedestrians, drivers, passengers to really exercise care when utilising our public road because we believe road safety begins with each and every road user."
