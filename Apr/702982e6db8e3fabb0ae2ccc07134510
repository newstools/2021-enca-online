The blame for the governance crisis at CSA is being placed at dismissed CEO Thabang Moroe's feet. JOHANNESBURG - Cricket South Africa staff are pleading with Sports Minister, Nathi Mthethwa to reconsider his decision to defund the cricket governing body. A letter signed by all 72 members of staff, says the decision will have a dire impact on livelihoods. They warn of more than a thousand job losses if recognition of the organisation is withdrawn. READ: Mali concerned by minister's intervention Last week, Mthethwa announced his intention to strip CSA of its rights as cricket’s governing body. Sascoc has also criticised Mthethwa’s call. It's urged the minister and the CSA Members Council to work with it to enhance governance of cricket in the country. The minister might reverse his decision to intervene but only if the Members' Council agrees to the establishment of a new memorandum of incorporation.
