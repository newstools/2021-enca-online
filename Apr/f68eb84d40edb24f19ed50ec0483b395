READ: Holomisa fed up with govt's response to COVID-19 pandemic It's in keeping with an ANC NEC resolution that members facing serious charges must step aside within 30-days. Holomisa proposes that the ANC executive hand over power to the Constitutional Court. "The Constitutional Court will, together with South Africans, discuss such as a thing as to what kind of interim government between now and 2024 [they want] and the ANC will have an opportunity to self-correct outside the government," he says. According to Holomisa, the interim arrangement can work with Parliament. Holomisa says the executive arm of the party has messed up the government and must leave.
