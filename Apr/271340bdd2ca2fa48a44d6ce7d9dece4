Aiden Markram (R) plays a shot as Pakistan's wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan (L) looks on during the third Twenty20 international cricket match between South Africa and Pakistan at SuperSport Park in Centurion on April 14, 2021. PRETORIA - Pakistan won the toss and decided to bowl in the third Twenty20 international against South Africa at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Wednesday. The four-match series is tied at 1-1. Leading batsman Rassie van der Dussen had recovered from a quad muscle injury and replaced the inexperienced Wihan Lubbe that won the second match in Johannesburg by six wickets on Monday. Pakistan made three changes. Hard-hitting batsman Fakhar Zaman had recovered from illness and replaced Sharjeel Khan, while batsman Asif Ali came in for leg-spinner Usman Qadir in what captain Babar Azam said was a move to strengthen the middle-order batting. Haris Rauf replaced fellow fast bowler Mohammad Hasnain. South African captain Heinrich Klaasen said he would also have chosen to bowl if he had won the toss. "It looks a good wicket. If there is anything in it, it will be upfront," he said.
