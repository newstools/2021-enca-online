Robert Lewandowski, seen here in Bayern Munich training last November, took part in running drills on Monday for the first time after a knee injury MUNICH - Bayern Munich's top-scorer Robert Lewandowski returned to training on Monday after a knee injury, but the club him ruled out of their Champions League quarter-final at Paris Saint-Germain. Bayern said Lewandowski "is not available" for Tuesday's second-leg in Paris. The holders need to overturn a 3-2 defeat after PSG striker Kylian Mbappe scored twice in Munich during last week's first leg. Lewandowski, 32, voted FIFA's best male player of 2020, injured ligaments in his right knee a fortnight ago while on international duty with Poland.
