Courtesy #DStv403  JOHANNESBURG - South Africa has received a refund for the AstraZeneca vaccine bought from the Serum Institute in India but, that won't be the case if the J&J and Pfizer vaccines are not used. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said this is because of a no-refund clause.

"With regards to the AstraZeneca refund, I can confirm in March we received the full AU 1 million doses which we sold to them. The amount paid was $5,2-million," Mkhize said.

We are therefore happy we have avoided what could have been fruitless and wasteful expenditure. "It is important to mention, that the J&J and Pfizer agreement have non-refundability clauses. The agreements specifically state the down payment will be made in advance by the department and shall not be refunded to us in any circumstances." #JohnsonandJohnson and Pfizer agreements with South Africa have non-refundable clauses. The agreements clearly states that the down payments made by the Dep is non-refundable in any circumstances.
