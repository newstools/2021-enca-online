That is the assertion of iconic freedom activist and retired Constitutional Court Judge, Albie Sachs. Sachs is confident President Ramaphosa will have a strong list of candidates to choose from. The Constitutional Court is set to have a new bench of judges. The Judicial Service Commission met earlier this month to interview candidates for judicial appointments. Nine candidates will be interviewed for two vacancies at the Constitutional Court. Overall, 88 candidates are scheduled for interviews to fill 31 vacancies at various courts. Ramaphosa will select his second set of Constitutional Court appointments. Later this year, the president will be required to fill the all-important Chief justice post when Mogoeng Mogoeng retires.

The stakes have never been so high "The Constitution allows for the key position of somebody whose powers, in a way, are equal to the powers of the president in terms of his judicial authority as head of the court," says Sachs. "The president makes a choice and then that person goes to the Judicial Service Commission to be vetted," he explains. For this position Sachs believes the new judge should have courage, collegiality, civility and craft. The important of these being 'courage'. "I do not mean take on enemies and smite your enemies an be oblivious of pain, I mean have the courage of your convictions," says Sachs. He says that South Africa has those kind of candidates and it is the reason the country's Constitutional Court has become renowned. Watch the video above for more details on this story.
