Byron Bay is a popular destination for tourists. AFP/Patrick Hamilton BYRON BAY - Surfers in the coastal Australian town of Byron Bay staged a "paddle out" protest as locals rally against a planned Netflix reality show they say will damage their beachside paradise. Local media images showed dozens of people who formed a symbol for 'no' in the ocean to demonstrate their opposition to the Netflix original series "Byron Baes", a pun on the informal term for "babe". In a statement announcing the show on April 7, the streaming giant said the "docu-soap" would follow Instagrammers without the filter of social media, promising "fights, flings and heartbreak". Netflix said the show was "our love letter to Byron Bay", saying the town was not just the backyard of Hollywood stars like Chris Hemsworth and Zac Efron but also "the playground of more celebrity-adjacent-adjacent influencers than you can poke a selfie-stick at". But many residents of the popular tourist town, about eight hours north of Sydney,Â believe the series would be harmful to the local community, which is dealing with the fallout of its rapidly rising popularity. An online petition calling on local councils not to grant filming permits to the producers in the "exploited paradise" has attracted almost 8,000 signatures, while some businesses are refusing to allow filming on their premises. "They are proposing to drag our name through the mud and make millions of dollars without offering anything back to the community and completely misrepresenting who we are, and it's totally wrong," Byron Bay cafe owner Ben Gordon told Channel Nine. Byron Bay mayor Simon Richardson said community opposition to the show was strong, telling public broadcaster ABC "you'd be struggling to find one person" who supported the Netflix plan.
