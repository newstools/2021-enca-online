"Our playing style, commitment and team spirit can get us to the final again," said the only survivor from the 2015 team that finished runners-up to Tunisian outfit Etoile Sahel. "I see no reason why we cannot become the first South African winners of the competition, especially after coming so close six years ago." Victory in Soweto will clinch a quarter-finals place for the Buccaneers while the Black Eagles need maximum points to retain a realistic chance of squeezing into the knockout phase. Although Pirates are first and Setif fourth in the table, the South Africans will be wary of an Algerian team that finally clicked nine days ago to hammer Enyimba 3-0. Second-place Enyimba lost their last four CAF away matches and have been battling to fund a charter flight to Libya.
