The former Democratic Alliance leader was reacting to President Cyril Ramaphosa's testimony at the commission. Maimane says the commission money should have been used to ensure arrests of corrupt people instead. READ: Ramaphosa back at Zondo Commission "We should have had criminal prosecutions take place parallel to the process so that those who are responsible for even complicity supporting corruption can be arrested," he said. "I think to even suggest that the ANC can self-correct is a mistake because comrades will look after comrades." Ramaphosa is expected to return to the commission. On Thursday, he told the commission the party could have done more to combat corruption.
