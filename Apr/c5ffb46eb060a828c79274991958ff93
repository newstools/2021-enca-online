Sisanda Magala delivers a ball during the third Twenty20 international cricket match between South Africa and Pakistan. AFP/Phill Magakoe JOHANNESBURG - It has been an eventful time for new Proteas bowler Sisanda Magala. He had mixed fortunes in the recent T20 series defeat to Pakistan. Magala has now been reprimanded by the ICC for contravening the code of conduct. His offence relates to regulations against the abuse of playing equipment. The bowler got into trouble for hitting the stumps in the fourth T20 against Pakistan. Magala was angry after bowling a no-ball and then being hit for six. A demerit point has also been added against his disciplinary record. Perhaps what will hurt Magala most is that Pakistan won the game and sealed a 3-1 series win.
