Salary negotiations between Public Sector Unions and government have deadlocked. Labour has confirmed the deadlock after government stuck to its position that it cannot afford to raise remmuneration during talks held late into Friday. eNCA's Thembekile Mrototo speaks to Denosa Second Deputy President Thandeka Msibi. Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Nursing union Denosa says public servants should not be sacrificed because they face the same burdens as other South Africans. This comes after unions rejected government's latest tabled wage offer. Unions have been asking for an increase above seven percent but government has remained firm in its decision not to give any increase to 1.3 million public servants. READ: Public Servants Association frustrated by government's offer "Public servants are community members, public servants are family members and they are suffering and having the pain that is endured by any other citizen of South Africa", said Denosa Second Deputy President Thandeka Msibi. "We are also having the problems of having hikes in fuel, the hikes in electricity, food has gone up and medical aids have also gone up. So we are members of the community and we are breadwinners." Unions are calling on members to prepare for a nationwide strike.
