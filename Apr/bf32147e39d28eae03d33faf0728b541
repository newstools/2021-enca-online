It says holding the elections this year will put the lives of South Africans at risk, especially considering the slow rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine. It further says the IEC will not have sufficient time to register all first-time voters. On Thursday, however, the IEC insisted it is ready to hold the local government elections this year. "We are not yet out of the danger of the pandemic," says IFP Gauteng provincial chairperson, Bonginkosi Dhlamini. "And we are told by the World Health Organization that for a country to open its activities, we must have vaccinated 60 percent of the population," says Dhlamini.
