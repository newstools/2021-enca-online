Jillian Alexander has always been an outgoing and chatty person. But when lockdown hit, Alexander - who's deaf - was struck by a silence she's never known before. Alexander communicates by reading lips, but this became a near-impossible task whenever she was out, due to the obligatory wearing of masks. eNCA's Monique Mortlock has the story.
