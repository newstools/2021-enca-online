Well, you don't need to imagine anymore. READ: NASA aims for historic helicopter flight on Mars NASA has successfully flown its Ingenuity helicopter on the red planet. The tiny chopper took flight and transmitted data a staggering 278-million kilometres back to Earth. NASA hopes Ingenuity will be a blueprint to revolutionise exploration of celestial bodies because the helicopters can reach areas that rovers can't, and travel much faster. "I don't think I can ever stop watching it..." #MarsHelicopter project manager MiMi Aung talks about how Ingenuity flew just the way they had expected it to fly.
