Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - South Africa is taking no chances. It's suspended the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The decision was taken after six women developed rare blood clotting disorders after having taken the jab in the US. No cases of blood clotting have been detected in South African healthcare workers who've taken the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. That's according to co-principal investigator for the Johnson & Johnson trial, Professor Glenda Gray.

It's important to note that we have seen these rare events in other vaccines. "These events have occurred, we're trying to establish whether the incidents are the same or different in the various vaccines. That data is ongoing." Meanwhile, the South African Medical Association says there's no need for panic. Its head, Angelique Coetzee, says she's been vaccinated and is not worried as the risk of clotting is low. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has temporarily suspended the rollout of J&J vaccines. It follows concerns from America's Health Authorities about potential clots developed in patients who have been vaccinated. Doctor Angelique Coetzee spoke to Sally Burdett. #DStv403
