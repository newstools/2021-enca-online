File: The Cheetahs have been left out of the Rainbow Cup. Backpagepix/Christiaan Kotze BLOEMFONTEIN - The Cheetahs Rugby Union is locking horns with SA Rugby, They are demanding answers as to why they were left out of the Rainbow Cup.
The South African competition -- which starts this weekend -- will see four South African teams doing battle, with the exclusion of the Cheetahs. The Bulls, Sharks, Lions and Stormers make up the tournament, with no indication of new competition or when the Cheetahs will play again. The union says its exclusion will have a negative impact on their Currie Cup preparations as well as the British and Irish Lions tour.
