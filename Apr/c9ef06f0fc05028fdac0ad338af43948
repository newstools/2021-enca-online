File: Minister Nathi Mthethwa. GCIS JOHANNESBURG - Sports Minister Nathi Mthethwa has intervened in the Cricket South Africa governance saga by de-funding the organisation and derecognising it. According to the statement, the Minister will publish this in the government gazette and then inform the ICC of his decision. The intervention comes after numerous attempts by the Minister to allow CSA and its Members Council to agree on a new governance structure. READ: Mthethwa expected to intervene on CSA matter CSA affiliates failed to ratify proposed changes to its governance structures. The council says the board's failure to afford it sufficient time to discuss the changes with affiliates led to the current standoff. According to the council, the draft Memorandum of Incorporation was sent on Friday midnight, ahead of the Special General Meeting on Saturday. A request for a seven-day extension was rejected. The council notes that the MOI needs to be endorsed by SASCOC, which has not happened.
