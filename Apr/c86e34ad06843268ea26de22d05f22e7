Courtesy #DStv403 CAPE TOWN - A food truck owner and popular burger chain RocoMama’s made news this week for a spat over the name of a burger. The beef started when Muammer Kasu received a lawyer’s letter instructing him to change his menus within 48 hours or face legal action. But the chef decided to take on the Spur Corporation which owns the burger chain. * eNCA's Nadine Theron reports.
