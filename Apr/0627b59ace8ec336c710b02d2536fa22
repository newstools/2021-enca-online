The United States has issued a Level 4 warning and is advising its citizens not to travel to the country. South Africa is one of 116 countries to be added to the 'Do Not Travel' list.

The council says the decision is unfair and the reasoning, illogical. CEO at TBCSA Tshifhiwa Tshivhengwa said: "I think it's unfair to us. The issues of crime have been, of all the tourists that have come to the country, there are few of them that have experienced crime.

The issue around COVID is largely influencing this type of decision," he said. "We in South Africa are not in crisis, we have problems and challenges, similar to what the US is having." Tshivhengwa said the US consulate must provide an explanation for the decision.
