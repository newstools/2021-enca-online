The ANC has asked provinces to submit the names of those in the party charged with corruption or other serious crimes by Thursday 5PM. The party also wants the names of those who allegedly committed corruption, as well as those reported or implicated in such practices. It follows the party’s NEC outcomes last month. It's raised not only debate within the governing party, but it seems, also serious divisions. #eNCA​ Courtesy #DStv403 KIMBERLY - Northern Cape Premier, Zamani Saul says the ANC will deal with members charged with corruption in the way the party's constitution stipulates.
