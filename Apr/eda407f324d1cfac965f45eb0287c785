Last week, the court gave the RAF a reprieve, saying it may pay claims within five months but it was instructed to settle claims already granted that are older than 180 days. CEO Collins Letsoalo says with the new model people won't be paid in lump sums. READ: RAF given five months to pay out any claims "We have been inundated for decades our assets have been attached. In recent years, people would as they get desperate, jump queue. "When you get a court order payment must be done in 14 days, but RAF doesn't have the money to be able to do that cause we have, what is called 'requested but not paid'," he said. "In 2019 September this amount was at R17-billion, from that we're getting only R3.6-billion monthly so we're asking the courts to allow people to queue. "We're paying anything above 180 days, so if you have a court order it will take anything from six months to be paid." Road Accident Fund CEO, Collins Letsoalo spoke with eNCA's Jane Dutton.
