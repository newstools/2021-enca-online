Chloe Zhao won the Oscar for best director. AFP/Chris Pizzello LOS ANGELES - Chloe Zhao on Sunday became only the second woman to win the Oscar for best director for her road movie "Nomadland" at a unique pandemic-era edition of Hollywood's biggest night. Zhao's drama about transient Americans roaming the West in vans is tipped to be one of the top winners overall on a night when Tinseltown A-listers are reuniting for the first time in more than a year.

Beijing-born Zhao's best director win makes her the first woman of colour ever honoured in the category, and the second female after Kathryn Bigelow, who broke the glass ceiling in 2010 when she won the prize for "The Hurt Locker." With movie theatres closed all year and blockbuster content delayed, Zhao's film captured the pandemic zeitgeist with its stunning portrait of the isolated margins of society, and has swept most of the awards shows in the run-up to the Oscars. Zhao, who has drawn controversy in China after years-old interviews resurfaced in which she appeared to criticise her country of birth, quoted classic Chinese poetry in her acceptance speech. READ: Award-dominating 'Nomadland' wins top Hollywood director prize The directing award was presented by last year's winner Bong Joon-ho, whose South Korean movie "Parasite" became the first film not in the English language to win best picture. He spoke from Seoul via videolink in Korean, with a translator, finishing with a few words in English. But "Nomadland" lost out early in the gala for best adapted screenplay to "The Father," adapted from his own stage production by French playwright Florian Zeller, who added to the international flavour by accepting from Paris.
