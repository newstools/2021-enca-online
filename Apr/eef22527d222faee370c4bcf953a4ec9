Of course, Tuesday is a holiday, Wednesday they get on. "We have a mid-term break coming but we start and each faculty will reorganise the curriculum because this week was supposed to test week for many faculties."

We missed you. This campus is not the same without you. So we have been hard at work preparing for your return. Welcome back home!
