"President Biden spoke with the family of George Floyd yesterday to check in with them and also share that the family was in his prayers," Press Secretary Jen Psaki tweeted. Derek Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter over Floyd's May 25, 2020 death during an arrest.

Earlier on Tuesday, Floyd's brother Philonise told NBC News that Biden, whose life has been scarred by the deaths of several close family members, had called. "He knows how it is to lose a family member. He knows the process of what we are going through." "He was just letting us know that he was praying for us, and hoping that everything would come out to be OK," the brother said.
