Tumisang Kakate said, "I don't think there was also that much that was placed before the court for him to be released on bail." "Other facts that he placed before the court, there were facts that were in existence when he did his first bail application, so I can't consider them as a new fact but again, what is of worry to us, was the fact that he ambushed the state with new information, which was totally different from the one that he initially indicated that he would be submitting to court, so that's why the proceedings were actually postponed today to the 22nd of April."
