Strong winds are hampering firefighting efforts at the University of Cape Town. Over 250 firefighters have been deployed to battle the blaze. Authorities are investigating the cause of the fire that ripped through parts of the City of Cape Town. The fire started at Table Mountain on Sunday morning and caused massive damage to property. "We battled the blaze from yesterday [Sunday] morning at 8.45am throughout the evening and we have so many resources currently on scene," said Jermaine Carelse from the City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue Services. WATCH: Table Mountain Park fire "This morning around about 1am to 2am, the fires were fanned by a strong south-easterly wind pumping today in Cape Town. So the fire has gone around the mountain to Tafelberg road-side, and we've now gotten additional resources to protect property at the bottom of Peppertree and Oaktree streets as well as Chelmsford Street. Those residents have been evacuated since before 5am." Two City firefighters and two firefighters from an external agency have been injured and have been transported to a hospital for further medical care. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. Everyone who would like to support the #UCTFire emergency relief fund is urged to please send financial donations to.
