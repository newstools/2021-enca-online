Ngoasheng said, "It's not surprising that various names are coming up, various names are being removed. If you think about who is part of RET, if you think about the links between Supra and Ace Magashule it shouldn't be surprising and I wouldn't be surprised if the person being referred to he said "don't step aside" to is Ace Magashule." "Everybody knows that once Ace Magashule is gone, everybody else that is equally as corrupt or is known to be corrupt, like him, is going to be removed," she said. "I am sure that Supra knew that if Ace Magashule is gone then he will be the next in line because he is facing similar allegations during his tenure, or his reign essentially, because these guys do behave like kings, in the North West."
