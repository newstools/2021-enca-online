BackpagePix/Muzi Ntombela JOHANNESBURG - Orlando Pirates got back to winning ways on Sunday, seeing off Maritzburg United in the DStv Premiership. The Buccaneers came into the clash reeling from a 4-1 loss to Sundowns, in the Nedbank Cup quarter-finals last week. The Soweto outfit remedied their woeful ways with a 2-0 win at Orlando Stadium. Vincent Pule scored a brace, netting in the 59th, before doubling his efforts in the 78th minute. The win edges the Sea Robbers back into the top four, tied on 38 points with third-placed Golden Arrows.
