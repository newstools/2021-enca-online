Strong winds which fanned the fires have died down considerably, giving the workers some respite. READ: Cape Town fires largely contained Efforts are now focused on Deer Park and the Disa Park towers in Vredehoek. The City's Fire & Rescue Services' Jermaine Carelse said no homes are in immediate danger as firefighters have got everything under control for now. He has urged the public to stay away from areas where crews are working, like Deer Park. #CapeTownFires With the wind dying down, helicopters can now come in to tackle some of the harder to reach fire spots. @eNCA pic.twitter.com/RL9CtdkOAw Despite this warning, we still saw people coming to the park to walk their dogs in Deer Park this morning. @eNCA pic.twitter.com/1jsBUEIqXd
