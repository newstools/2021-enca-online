AFP/Christian Petersen/Getty Images LOS ANGELES - Yuka Saso and Brittany Altomare shared the lead in the opening round of the LPGA Lotte Championship, finishing atop a tight leaderboard that also includes Canadian Brooke Henderson in search of her third straight title. Saso, a 19-year-old from the Philippines who made history for her country with double Asian Games golf gold in 2018, was first in the clubhouse on eight-under-par 64, racing home with four of her eight birdies at her last four holes. American Altomare followed with an even more impressive surge, stringing together seven straight birdies after the turn on the way to nine birdies and a bogey for an eight-under total. Saso, a two-time winner on the Japan LPGA tour, said there was no real secret to her success at Kapolei Golf Club in Oahu, Hawaii. "I made some good putts, had good up and downs, my driving was very consistent today," said Saso, who is playing this week on a sponsor's exemption. Saso knows the going could be tougher when she tees off in the afternoon on Friday, when the wind is likely to be more of a factor. "Back nine the wind did get stronger than this morning," said Saso, who opened with a birdie on 10 and added birdies at 17 and 18 and the fourth before reeling off birdies at six, seven, eight and nine. "I think I just have to be careful with my drives, keep it in the fairway as much as possible, and trust the process."
