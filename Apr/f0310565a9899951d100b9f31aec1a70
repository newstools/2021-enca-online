AFP/Ben Stansall LONDON - Military guns will be fired across Britain and sporting events will fall silent on Saturday as part of worldwide tributes to mark the death of Queen Elizabeth II's husband, Prince Philip. Philip, the longest-serving royal consort in British history and a constant presence at the queen's side for decades, died on Friday aged 99, triggering a period of national mourning. The death of the Duke of Edinburgh is a profound loss for the 94-year-old monarch, who once described him as her "strength and stay all these years".

From noon, saluting batteries will fire 41 rounds -- one round a minute for 40 minutes -- in cities including London, Edinburgh, Cardiff and Belfast, as well as in Gibraltar and from Royal Navy warships at sea. The Premier League and other sporting events are expected to pay their respects, with the Football Association recommending that black armbands be worn and a minute's silence observed before this weekend's matches.

The well-rehearsed protocol for the duke's death -- codenamed "Forth Bridge" -- includes the recall of parliament on Monday. British television stations cleared their schedules for special broadcasts looking back on his life. Westminster Abbey, where the couple married in 1947, tolled its tenor bell 99 times on Friday, once for each year of the prince's life.
