They are asking drivers to be responsible and exercise caution so that accidents can be avoided. WATCH: Transporting alcohol allowed over Easter weekend Last year 28 people died on the country's roads during the Easter period, the lowest number in recent years due to the lockdown but with eased regulations this year, authorities say there are some concerns. Traffic officials will be deployed across the country to ensure compliance. With the long Easter weekend drawing to a close, holidaymakers are preparing to head back to their various destinations. People were unable to travel last year because the country's lockdown restrictions prohibited interprovincial travel but this year under lockdown alert level 1, traveling is permitted.
