Courtesy #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - Parliament's Health Portfolio Committee chair, Sibongiseni Dhlomo, is urging health Minister Zweli Mkhize to settle concerns about the Johnson and Johnson vaccine. Dhlomo is, however, confident South Africa will be able to restart the J&J Sisonke vaccination program soon. That is after its rollout was halted following blood clot cases in the US.

"We're actually understanding [that] we can't ignore international opinion. However, our situation is that we must work quickly and faster and remove that as a factor to restart the program," says Dhlomo. He says that SAHPRA is correct that other countries are looking into the vaccine's efficacy and safety. As the portfolio committee they are urging the health minister and scientists to look into it quickly and expediate the program restart. Watch the interview above for more details on this story
