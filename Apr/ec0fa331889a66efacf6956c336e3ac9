Monique Mortlock reporting in Khayelitsha, Cape Town. CAPE TOWN - The eNCA Cape Town crew was robbed at gunpoint on Tuesday afternoon after crossing live on The Lead. Reporter Monique Mortlock and camera operator Asanda Javu were in Khayelistha, reporting on the lack of service delivery in the area. READ: eNCA journalists robbed at gunpoint Their camera kit and cellphones were taken. We were just robbed at gunpoint in Khayelitsha after doing a crossing. Now my colleague and I have to deal with an inept police officer telling us we can't open the case at this station (a 2 min drive from where it happened) because it's not in their jurisdiction WTF They’re at the police station now opening a case.
