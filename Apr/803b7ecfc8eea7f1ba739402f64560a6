He has earmarked the country's jab campaign as a policy priority, alleging vaccine delivery was hindered by outgoing authorities. "The arrival of vaccines has been delayed by political, not financial, considerations," he said. The World Health Organization said that two new variants of the coronavirus are present in Libya. Officially, Libya has registered a total of around 167,000 coronavirus cases, including over 2,800 deaths, out of a population of seven million.
