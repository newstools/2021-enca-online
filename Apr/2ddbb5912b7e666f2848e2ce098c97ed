AFP/Christiaan Kotze JOHANNESBURG - Pakistan won the toss and sent South Africa in to bat in the second one-day international at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Sunday. As in the first match in Centurion on Friday, Pakistan captain Babar Azam said his side would try to exploit early moisture in the pitch in an effort to wrap up the three-match series with one game to spare. Pakistan won a dramatic opening game by three wickets, scoring the winning run off the last ball. The series is being played unusually late in the season for South Africa, with shorter days and cooler weather making batting conditions tricky for batsmen early in a game. "We had a good chat about areas we can improve on," said South African captain Temba Bavuma. READ:Â Cricket SA: Members' Council rejects proposed changes Both teams were unchanged.
