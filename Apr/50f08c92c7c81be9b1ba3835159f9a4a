The High Court in Pretoria has reserved judgment in the case of a sperm donor who wishes to be part of the four-year-old boy’s life. The difficult question in this matter is: What is right for the child? The sperm donor and his mother don’t want custody but are asking for the right to play a supplementary role in the boy’s life by becoming his guardians. But the same-sex couple who received the sperm donation say the gifts and visits weren’t welcome, to begin with, and that they felt obliged to comply. Both legal teams are confident of their cases. * eNCA's Nqobile Madlala reports. A man who donated his sperm to a same sex couple has approached the Gauteng high court for access to the child.
