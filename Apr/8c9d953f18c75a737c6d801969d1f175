He had been attending an unregistered drug rehabilitation centre when he went missing. His body was found two weeks later. The body of Emilio Davids was found decapitated and lying next to a chainsaw in an open veld - where the community of Ennerdale held a memorial service in honour of his young life.

"He was such a gentle soul, absolutely beautiful boy," she says.
 
The family is desperate for answers – and justice. Davids disappeared from the Hidden with Christ drug rehab centre on the 11th of March, and his butchered remains were found two weeks later.
