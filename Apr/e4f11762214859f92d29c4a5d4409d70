There was little social distancing and few masks at packed venues. Law enforcement authorities along with Gauteng Community Safety MEC, Faith Mazibuko conducted operations to enforce adjusted lockdown level one regulations in the area. "With the detective operations we had a total of 146 arrests, of which 30 of those arrests are for gender-based violence," said acting provincial commissioner of police in Gauteng, Major General Tommy Mthombeni. WATCH: Congregants arrested for violating lockdown regulations Mazibuko says it is demoralising to see so many people ignoring Covid-19 regulations. “Indeed, it is saddening and demoralising to think that as government we are putting every effort in reducing the numbers and even the President putting regulations, but still people just ignore those regulations," she said. "Others are walking without masks, lots and lots of gatherings, street bashes. People are carrying cooler boxes, sitting on the pavement, cars blocking the road."
