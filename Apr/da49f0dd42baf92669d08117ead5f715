Faheem Ashraf took three for 17 to spark South Africa's collapse in the fourth Twenty20 at Centurion PRETORIA - Pakistan medium-pace bowler Faheem Ashraf sparked a South African collapse in the fourth and final Twenty20 international at SuperSport Park in Centurion on Friday. Faheem took three for 17 as South Africa, who were put into bat after losing the toss, were bowled out for 144 on what is usually a high-scoring ground. South Africa had reached 73 for one after the early loss of Aiden Markram when Faheem had Janneman Malan caught at mid-off for 33 in the ninth over.
