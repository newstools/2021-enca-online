Delta reported another quarterly loss but signalled it could return to profitability later in 2021. AFP/Daniel Slim NEW YORK - Delta Air Lines reported another quarterly loss but pointed to an expected return to profitability later in 2021 amid quickly rising travel demand. The big US carrier was cashflow positive in March for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit a year earlier as more newly-vaccinated Americans booked vacations. "We are now seeing more normal booking behaviour as customers make plans for spring and summer travel," Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian said in a conference call, adding that 75 percent of customers expect to be vaccinated by Memorial Day.

Revenues were down 60 percent at $4.2-billion. Delta expects a smaller loss in the second quarter "and we see a path to returning to profitability in the September quarter," Bastian said. Delta plans to resume booking its middle seats in May, which will boost revenues at a time of rising demand and broadening deployment of Covid-19 vaccines. Company officials said they already are seeing a strong recovery in vacation bookings, with leisure travel now 85 percent recovered compared to 2019 levels.
