Courtesy of #DStv403 JOHANNESBURG - For many, Freedom Day is a reminder of the role Nelson Mandela played in the fight for freedom in South Africa. eNCA spoke to Jay Naidoo who served as minister for reconstruction and development in the first post-apartheid cabinet under Mandela. WATCH: Nelson Mandela remembered He reflected on what Madiba meant to the building of freedom in our country. "This is what I remember of him on this very precious day... As he pierced the veil of pain and suffering, he transcended the limitations of mind, body, and intellect. And he saw the incredible trellis of life." "The unlimited potential of the intelligence we possess. That Divine Energy we are all part of. Indivisible. Interconnected. We are one with everything we share our Mother Earth with. The People. The eagle. The land. The forest. The river. The ocean. Everything is sacred." And that’s why he was a priceless gift to us and the world. His forgiving heart, his generous spirit of reconciliation." "His endearing hands of compassion, comforting our sorrows, reaching out across the chasms of our deep racial and class divisions. Coaxing us to work together. To rise above our narrow constituencies and our diametrically opposed views to find the common ground. To remind us that every conflict, every war has to end with the protagonists sitting around the table to rebuild the bridges of healing our bleeding wounds and building a more intelligent cooperation."
