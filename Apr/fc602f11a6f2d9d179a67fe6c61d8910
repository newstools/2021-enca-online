AFP/Charly Triballeau JOHANNESBURG - Nearly seven months after picking up a nasty knee injury, South Africa's Rugby World Cup winner Handre Pollard is returning to action. Pollard is set to feature for Montpellier in the coming weeks, according to coach Philippe Saint-Andre. The 27-year-old made just two appearances this season for his club and last donned the green and gold in the 2019 World Cup final. Boks coach Jacques Nienaber hinted that Pollard could be back next month and he will be fit to face the British and Irish Lions in summer.
