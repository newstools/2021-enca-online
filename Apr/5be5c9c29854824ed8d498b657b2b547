AFP/Chaideer Mahyuddin STOCKHOLM - A two-week-old elephant has died after being rejected by her family following the birth of another elephant calf, Sweden's Boras Zoo announced on Friday. "Despite three days of intensive care with a vet and carers at her side night and day the little animal left us today," the zoo said in a post on Instagram showing keepers surrounding the mammal. "Her body could not take any more and she had to go to sleep". A post shared by Borås zoo (@boraszoo) The female was born on March 26 and had yet to be given a name. She was rejected after the birth on Monday of a male elephant at the zoo. The zoo said there was nothing that could be done to stop the rejection. "We are all very saddened, but at the same time we are trying to rejoice that the other elephant seems alert and awake," the message added.
