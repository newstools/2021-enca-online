JOHANNESBURG -Â Armed security guards have been deployed to prevent more than 2,000 people from an attempted land invasion in Rabie Ridge in Johannesburg. This after an earlier stand-off. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades while the JMPD used a water cannon to try and disperse the crowd. Some community members said they just want land. "They must come and show us the title deeds," said a man. "We are sick and tired of these people with money who come and buy the land to sell it to government officials. "We want the government to hear us."
