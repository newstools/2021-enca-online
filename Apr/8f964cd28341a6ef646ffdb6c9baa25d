Members of metalworkers' union Numsa marched to the RMI's offices across several provinces on Tuesday. Twitter/Numsa Media JOHANNESBURG - Trade union Numsa is sitting out this year's Freedom Day commemorations. It says there is nothing to celebrate. That's because democracy has not yielded the results many South Africans, especially the Black working class, were hoping for when they first voted for the ANC in 1994. "27 years after the working class paid the ultimate price with their blood to end the apartheid system. The African majority remains enslaved by the bondage of poverty and unemployment," says Numsa spokesperson Phakamile Hlubi-Majola "The governing ANC has been a dismal failure in addressing the most important challenges facing our country, namely unemployment, poverty and inequality," she adds.

Meanwhile, the South African Federation of Trade Unions has echoed NUMSA's sentiments saying there's nothing to celebrate this Freedom Day. SAFTU says apartheid exposed black people to many injustices such as poor education, cheap labour and unfair discrimination. The labour federation says poor people who rely on government are still subjected to arrests and killings during protests. It has criticised the laying off of over 1 million people last year. SAFTU says the working class must increase its fighting capacity to resist the capitalist's onslaught.
