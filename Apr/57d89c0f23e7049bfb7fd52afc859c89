Ashleigh Barty made her Roland Garros debut in 2012. AFP/Martin Bureau PARIS - As former champion Ashleigh Barty prepares for Roland Garros on May 30, the Australian brushed off any regrets about missing the French Open last year. She won her only major singles title in Paris in 2019 but after the 2020 event was postponed to September/October she chose not to attend due to issues related to the pandemic. "It's a long time since I've played at the French Open," she said in Stuttgart on Monday, ahead of her first match on European clay in almost two years. In her absence the 2020 women's Roland Garros title was won by Iga Swiatek.

But Barty said 2021 would be an all-around reset. "It's a fresh start, a fresh start for everyone at that event." She made clear that her approach was also practical.

Even though she skipped much of last season, she is ranked No. 1 in the world and won the hard-court Miami Open which preceded Charleston, but she was cagey about her form. "From the outside, it's judged on results, which can be accurate," she said. "There have been times I've felt I've been in great form but haven't been winning matches and vice versa. Other ones when I haven't been able to find anything close to the middle of the racket but you find a way through matches." "It's important not to be completely results-driven when you're thinking of your form." Barty, who is from Queensland, took a break last year to avoid travelling during the pandemic.
