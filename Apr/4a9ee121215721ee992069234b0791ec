Masakhane Sotayisi has travelled the world performing opera. He was preparing for a European tour when the pandemic struck last year, leaving him stranded at home for the time being. While spending more time with his three beloved dogs he realised it doesn’t help if his pooches are washed regularly, if his neighbours’ dogs are not clean as well. Nadine Theron reports.

An opera singer from Cape Town has turned his love for dogs into a community project and enterprise. Masakhane Sotayisi’s pet wash is run from his parents’ house in Khayelitsha. Here, he and his brothers clean about 20 dogs a day at a small fee. * eNCA's Nadine Theron reports.
