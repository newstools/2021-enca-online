Pillay had been interviewed for a position at the Supreme Court of Appeal.
Gordhan says he does not recall the agenda of the meeting with Mogoeng but he insists it was not to discuss Pillay. READ: Gordhan insists SAA can be saved He says he's only ever met with the Chief Justice to discuss professional matters.
