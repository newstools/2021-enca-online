JOHANNESBURG - SA Express to remain in provisional liquidation until 28 July 2021. The Pretoria High Court has granted another extension after Numsa brought  an application opposing final liquidation. READ: Time running out for SA Express The airline has been mired in turbulence over the past year with the liquidation cloud hanging over its operations. BREAKING: SA Express will remain in provisional liquidation until 28 July 2021. The Pretoria High Court granted another extension. This time on the basis of a pending application by NUMSA to the Constitutional Court opposing final liquidation. #SAExpress There was a preferred bidder/buyer for SA Express called Fly SAX but due to failure to provide a guarantee or payment, they did not meet the requirements. Prov liquidators therefore asked for an extension on the order of final liquidation to allow for NUMSA application. Fly SAX has also asked the #SAExpress provisional liquidators to give them more time to come up with the funding. They’ve managed to raise R24 million of the R50 million. What’s key here is that state owned SA Express does not go into final liquidation. Hence the application by NUMSA to the Con Court.
